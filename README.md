# Cordova Docs / Website

This repository contains the source code for the Cordova website at [cordova.apache.org](https://cordova.apache.org).

## Technical Overview

The main parts are built as a static site with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), containing the homepage and subpages, the [blog](https://cordova.apache.org/blog) and the [docs](https://cordova.apache.org/docs).  
The [plugin search](https://cordova.apache.org/plugins) is an embedded PreactJS application.

Here in the repository the code of the actual site is located in [`/www`](www) with its subfolder [`/docs`](www/docs), [`/blog`](www/blog) and [`/plugins`](www/plugins).  
Some additional content is [pulled in during the build process](TODO).

The site is built using a [gulp script](gulpfile.js) that is run by Node.JS (`npm run-script build`). (Alternatively you can build the site using Make.) Deployments usually happen on commits to `master` via Travis, which runs [`buildAndDeploy.sh`](buildAndDeploy.sh) and commits the built site to a SVN repository.
