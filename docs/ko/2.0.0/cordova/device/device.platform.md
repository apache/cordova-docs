            element.innerHTML = 'Device Name: '     + device.name     + '<br />' + 
                                'Device Cordova: '  + device.cordova  + '<br />' +

        }

        </script>

      </body>
    </html>
    
iPhone Quirks
-------------

The iPhone returns `iPhone` as the platform. The iPad returns `iPad` as the platform.  In the simulator they will return `iPhone Simulator` and `iPad Simulator` respectively.  These are inaccurate in all cases because Apple has rebranded the iPhone operating system as `iOS`.

BlackBerry Quirks
-----------------

Devices may return the device platform version instead of the platform name.  For example, the Storm2 9550 would return '2.13.0.95' or similar.

Windows Phone 7 Quirks
-----------------

Windows Phone 7 devices report platform as 'WinCE'
