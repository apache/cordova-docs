capture.captureImage
====================

> Start the camera application and return information about captured image file(s).

    navigator.device.capture.captureImage( 
	    CaptureCB captureSuccess, CaptureErrorCB captureError, [CaptureImageOptions options]
	);

Description
-----------

This method starts an asynchronous operation to capture images using the device camera application.  The operation allows the device user to capture multiple images in a single session.

The capture operation ends when either the user exits the camera application, or the maximum number of images, specified by the __limit__ parameter in CaptureImageOptions, has been reached.  If no value is provided for the __limit__ parameter, a default value of one (1) is used, and the capture operation will terminate after the user captures a single image.

When the capture operation is finished, it will invoke the CaptureCB callback with an array of MediaFile objects describing each captured image file.  If the operation is terminated by the user before an image is captured, the CaptureErrorCB callback will be invoked with a CaptureError object with the CaptureError.`CAPTURE_NO_MEDIA_FILES` error code.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- Android
- BlackBerry WebWorks (OS 5.0 and higher)
- iOS
- Windows Phone 7 ( Mango )
- Bada 2.x

Windows Phone 7 Quirks
----------------------

Invoking the native camera application while your device is connected
via Zune will not work, and the error callback will be triggered.

Quick Example
-------------

    // capture callback
    var captureSuccess = function(mediaFiles) {
        var i, path, len;
        for (i = 0, len = mediaFiles.length; i < len; i += 1) {
            path = mediaFiles[i].fullPath;
            // do something interesting with the file
        }
    };

    // capture error callback
    var captureError = function(error) {
        navigator.notification.alert('Error code: ' + error.code, null, 'Capture Error');
    };

    // start image capture
    navigator.device.capture.captureImage(captureSuccess, captureError, {limit:2});

Bada Quirks
-----------

Bada supports _captureImage_ just like the other platforms. However there is _another_ mode where you can capture a video or an image straight in the webview without launching any camera app. In order to do that you need to:

1. create a _&#60;div&#62;_ element somewhere in your document and give it an id (such as "preview"). 

        <div id="preview"></div>

2. Initialize the camera preview with the following method

        navigator.camera.showPreview("preview");

3. Once you get the preview you can

    3.1 Capture an image with

        var options = { destinationFilename: "images/cam01.jpg", highRes: false};
        navigator.capture.captureImage(success, fail, options);
    
3. Hide the camera preview with the following method

        navigator.camera.hidePreview("preview");
