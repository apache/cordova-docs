deviceready
===========

This is an event that fires when Cordova is fully loaded.

    document.addEventListener("deviceready", yourCallbackFunction, false);

Details
-------

This is a very important event that every Cordova application should use.

Cordova consists of two code bases: native and JavaScript. While the native code is loading, a custom loading image is displayed. However, JavaScript is only loaded once the DOM loads. This means your web application could, potentially, call a Cordova JavaScript function before it is loaded.

The Cordova `deviceready` event fires once Cordova has fully loaded. After the device has fired, you can safely make calls to Cordova function.

Typically, you will want to attach an event listener with `document.addEventListener` once the HTML document's DOM has loaded.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- Android
- BlackBerry WebWorks (OS 5.0 and higher)
- iOS
- Windows Phone 7
- Bada 1.2 & 2.x

Quick Example
-------------

    document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

    function onDeviceReady() {
        // Now safe to use the Cordova API
    }

Full Example
------------

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Cordova Device Ready Example</title>

        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="cordova-2.0.0.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">

        // Call onDeviceReady when Cordova is loaded.
        //
        // At this point, the document has loaded but cordova-2.0.0.js has not.
        // When Cordova is loaded and talking with the native device,
        // it will call the event `deviceready`.
        //
        function onLoad() {
            document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
        }

        // Cordova is loaded and it is now safe to make calls Cordova methods
        //
        function onDeviceReady() {
            // Now safe to use the Cordova API
        }

        </script>
      </head>
      <body onload="onLoad()">
      </body>
    </html>
