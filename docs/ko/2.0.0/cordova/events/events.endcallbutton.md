endcallbutton
===========

This is an event that fires when the user presses the end call button.

    document.addEventListener("endcallbutton", yourCallbackFunction, false);

Details
-------

If you need to override the default end call behaviour you can register an event listener for the 'endcallbutton' event.

Typically, you will want to attach an event listener with `document.addEventListener` once you receive the Cordova 'deviceready' event.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- BlackBerry WebWorks (OS 5.0 and higher)

Quick Example
-------------

    document.addEventListener("endcallbutton", onEndCallKeyDown, false);

    function onEndCallKeyDown() {
        // Handle the end call button
    }
