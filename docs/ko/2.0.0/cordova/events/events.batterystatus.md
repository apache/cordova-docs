batterystatus
===========

This is an event that fires when a Cordova application detects a change in the battery status.

    window.addEventListener("batterystatus", yourCallbackFunction, false);

Details
-------

This event that fires when a Cordova application detects the percentage of battery has changed by at least 1 percent. It is also fired if the device has been plugged in or un-plugged.

The battery status handler will be called with an object that contains two properties:

- __level:__ The percentage of battery (0-100). _(Number)_
- __isPlugged:__ A boolean that represents whether or not the device is plugged in or not. _(Boolean)_

Typically, you will want to attach an event listener with `window.addEventListener` once you receive the Cordova 'deviceready' event.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- iOS
- Android
- BlackBerry WebWorks (OS 5.0 and higher)
- Windows Phone 7 ( Mango )


Windows Phone 7 Quirks
----------------------

The `level` property is unavailable as Windows Phone 7 does not provide
native APIs for determining battery level. The `isPlugged` parameter
_is_ supported.

Quick Example
-------------

    window.addEventListener("batterystatus", onBatteryStatus, false);

    function onBatteryStatus(info) {
        // Handle the online event
       	console.log("Level: " + info.level + " isPlugged: " + info.isPlugged); 
    }
