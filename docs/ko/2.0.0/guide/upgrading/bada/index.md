Upgrading Cordova Bada
======================

This document is for people who need to upgrade their Cordova versions from an
older version to a current version of Cordova.

## Upgrade to 1.9.0 from 2.0.0 ##

1. Update `Res/js/cordova.js` with the new JavaScript file.

## Upgrade to 1.9.0 from 1.8.x ##

1. Update `Res/js/cordova.js` with the new JavaScript file.

## Upgrade to 1.8.x from 1.7.0 ##

1. Remove the cordova.bada.js file from the Res/js directory 
2. Add the new cordova.js file to your Res/js directory 
3. Update your Res/index.html to reference cordova.js instead of cordova.bada.js 

Change this line:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="./js/cordova.bada.js"></script>
to:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="./js/cordova.js"></script>

As of Cordova 1.8, Bada 1.2 is no longer supported! The repository will be kept
there as an archive for people who still want to use it. It contains some outdated APIs.
