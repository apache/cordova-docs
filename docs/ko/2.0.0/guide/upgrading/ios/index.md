Upgrading Cordova iOS
=====================

Please note that **Xcode 4 is required**. To submit to the Apple App Store, you must use the latest shipped version of the iOS SDK, which is iOS 5.1. The iOS 5.1 SDK requires Xcode 4.

## Upgrading Cordova 1.9.0 projects to 2.0.0 ##

1. **Install** Cordova 2.0.0
2. **Create a new project** from the command-line tools - you will have to grab the assets from this new project
3. **Copy** the **www/cordova-2.0.0.js** file from the new project into your **www** folder, and delete your **www/cordova-1.9.0.js** file
4. **Update** the Cordova script reference in your **www/index.html** file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new **cordova-2.0.0.js** file
5. Copy the **"cordova"** folder from the new project into your project's root folder (if you want the project command-line tools) 
6. **Add** a new entry under **Plugins** in your **Cordova.plist** file (under the **Supporting Files** group) - the key is **Device** and the value is **CDVDevice**
7. Remove **Cordova.framework**
8. Remove **verify.sh** from the **Supporting Files** group
9. Select the **project icon** in the Project Navigator, select your project **Target**, then select the **"Build Settings"** tab
10. Search for **"Preprocessor Macros"**, then remove all **"CORDOVA_FRAMEWORK=1"** values
11. Locate the **CordovaLib** folder that was installed in your hard-drive under your home folder's **Documents** sub-folder.
12. Locate the **CordovaLib.xcodeproj** file in the **CordovaLib** folder, then **drag and drop** the file into your project - it should appear as a **sub-project**.
13. **Build** your project, you should get some **errors** relating to **#import** directives
14. For the **#import errors**, change any **quote-based** imports in this style:

        #import "CDV.h"
        
    to this **brackets-based** style:
    
        #import <Cordova/CDV.h>
        
    and remove any **#ifdef** wrappers around any Cordova imports, they are not needed anymore (the imports are **unified** now)    
15. **Build** your project again, and it should not have any **#import** errors.
16. Select the **project icon** in the Project Navigator, select your project **Target**, then select the **"Build Phases"** tab
17. Expand the **"Target Dependencies"** phase, then select the **"+"** button
18. Select the **"CordovaLib"** target, then select the **"Add"** button
19. Expand the **first** **"Link Binary with Libraries"** phase (it should already contain a bunch of frameworks), then select the **"+"** button
20. Select the **libCordova.a** static library, then select the **"Add"** button
21. Delete the **"Run Script"** phase.
22. Select the **project icon** in the Project Navigator, select your project **Target**, then select the **"Build Settings"** tab
23. Search for **"Other Linker Flags"**, and add the values **-all_load** and **-Obj-C**
24. Expand the **"CordovaLib" sub-project**
25. Locate the **"VERSION"** file, drag it into your main project (we want to create a link to it, not a copy)
26. Select the **"Create groups for any added folders"** radiobutton, then select the **"Finish"** button
27. Select the **"VERSION"** file that you just dragged in a previous step
28. Press the key combination **Option-Command-1** to show the **File Inspector** (or menuitem **View -> Utilities -> Show File Inspector**)
29. Choose **"Relative to CORDOVALIB"** in the **File Inspector** for the drop-down menu for **Location**
30. **Build** your project, it should compile and link with **no issues**.
31. **Select your project** from the **Scheme** drop-down, and then select **"iPhone 5.1 Simulator"**
32. Select the **Run** button

**NOTE 1:**<br /> 
If your project is **not working** as expected in the Simulator, please **take a note of any errors** in the **console log in Xcode** for clues.

**NOTE 2:**<br /> 
For the **unified #import headers** to work, the build products should **build into the same build directory**. You may need to set the preference **"Xcode Preferences -> Locations -> Derived Data -> Advancedâ€¦"** to **"Unique"**

## Upgrading Cordova 1.8.x projects to 1.9.0 ##

1. **Install** Cordova 1.9.0
2. **Create a new project** - you will have to grab assets from this new project

4. **Update** the Cordova script reference in your **www/index.html** file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new **cordova-1.9.0.js** file

**Note:**

1.9.0 supports the new **"BackupWebStorage"** boolean setting in Cordova.plist. By default, this setting is turned on, set it to "false" to turn it off - especially for iOS 6 - see [Release Notes - Safari and UIKit Section](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/#releasenotes/General/RN-iOSSDK-6_0/_index.html)


## Upgrading Cordova 1.7.0 projects to 1.8.x ##

1. **Install** Cordova 1.8.0
2. **Create a new project** - you will have to grab assets from this new project

If you intend on using the **Capture API**, you will need the new **iPad retina-display** assets:

1.  **Copy** the **Resources/Capture.bundle** item from the new project into your project folder, over-writing your existing **Resources/Capture.bundle** item
2.  In your project, select the **Capture.bundle** item into Xcode into your Project Navigator, and press the **Delete** key, then select **Remove Reference** from the dialog that pops up.
3.  Drag the new **Capture.bundle** from Step 1. above into Xcode into your Project Navigator, and select the **Create groups for any added folders** radio-button
