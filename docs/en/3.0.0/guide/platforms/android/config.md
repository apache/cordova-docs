# Android Configuration

The `config.xml` file controls various Cordova settings. These apply
across the application, and per CordovaWebView instance.

## `<preference>`

Various other preferences (as `<preference>` tags) default on not
breaking existing apps. The available preferences are:

* `useBrowserHistory` (boolean, defaults to `true`): set to `false` if you
  want to use the history shim that was used to work around the
  hashtag error present in Android 3.x prior to the history fix.
  (Note: This setting will be deprecated in April 2013)

* `loadingDialog`: Display a native loading dialog when loading the
  app. The value's format is _Title, Message_

* `loadingPageDialog`: Display a native loading dialog when loading
  sub-pages. The value's format is _Title, Message_

* `errorUrl`: Set the error page for your application. Should be
  located in your Android project in `file://android_asset/www/`

* `backgroundColor`: Set the background color for your application.
  Supports a four-byte hex value, with the first byte representing
  alpha value, and the following three bytes with standard RGB
  values. For example, `0x00000000` is black.

* `loadUrlTimeoutValue`: How much time Cordova should wait before
  throwing a timeout error on the application.

* `keepRunning` (boolean, defaults to `true`): Determines whether
  Cordova stays running in the background. Note: setting this to 
  false will not kill the app after a pause event, it will only 
  halt execution of code in the cordova webview while the app is 
  in the background.

* `splashscreen`: The name of the file minus its extension in the
  `res/drawable` directory.  If you have multiple assets, they all
  must share this common name in their respective directories.

* `disallowOverscroll` (boolean, defaults to `false`): set to `true` to
  disable the glow when a user scrolls beyond the edge of the webview.

## `<plugin>`

Android supports using `<feature>` as analogues to `<plugin>` elements.
