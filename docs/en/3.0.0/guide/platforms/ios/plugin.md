# iOS Plugins

A plugin is an Objective-C class that extends the `CDVPlugin` class.

Each plugin class must be registered as a `<feature>` tag in the
`config.xml` file. It is through this mechanism that JavaScript's `exec`
method's `service` parameter maps to an Objective-C class.

## Plugin Class Mapping

The JavaScript portion of a plugin always uses the `cordova.exec` method as follows:

    exec(<successFunction>, <failFunction>, <service>, <action>, [<args>]);

This marshals a request from the `UIWebView` to the iOS native side,
more or less boiling down to calling the `action` method on the
`service` class, with the arguments passed in the `args` array.

Specifiy the plugin as a `<feature>` tag in your Cordova-iOS
application's project's `config.xml` file.

    <feature name="LocalStorage">
        <param name="ios-package" value="CDVLocalStorage" />
    </feature>

The feature `name` attribute should match what you use in the JavaScript
`exec` call's `service` parameter, and the `value` attribute should match the name of the plugin's
Objective-C class. `<param name>` should always be `"ios-package"`.
If you do not follow this setup, the plugin may compile but will not be
reachable by Cordova.

## Plugin Initialization and Lifetime

One instance of a plugin object is created for the life of each
`UIWebView`. Plugins are not instantiated until they are first
referenced by a call from JavaScript, unless `<param>` with an `onload`
`name` attribute is set to `"true"` in `config.xml`. E.g.:

    <feature name="Echo">
        <param name="ios-package" value="Echo" />
        <param name="onload" value="true" />
    </feature>

There is _no_ designated initializer for plugins. Instead, plugins
should use the `pluginInitialize` method for their start-up logic.

Plugins with long-running requests, background activity (e.g., playing
media), listeners or internal state should implement the `onReset`
method and stop or clean up those activities. This method is run when
the `UIWebView` navigates to a new page or refreshes, which reloads
the JavaScript.

## Writing an iOS Cordova Plugin

We have JavaScript fire off a plugin request to the native side. We have the iOS Objective-C plugin mapped properly via the `config.xml` file. So what does the final iOS Objective-C Plugin class look like?

What gets dispatched to the plugin via JavaScript's `exec` function gets passed into the corresponding Plugin class's `action` method. A plugin method has this signature:

    - (void)myMethod:(CDVInvokedUrlCommand*)command
    {
        CDVPluginResult* pluginResult = nil;
        NSString* myarg = [command.arguments objectAtIndex:0];

        if (myarg != nil) {
            pluginResult = [CDVPluginResult resultWithStatus:CDVCommandStatus_OK];
        } else {
            pluginResult = [CDVPluginResult resultWithStatus:CDVCommandStatus_ERROR messageAsString:@"Arg was null"];
        }
        [self.commandDelegate sendPluginResult:pluginResult callbackId:command.callbackId];
    }

1. [CDVInvokedUrlCommand.h](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/blob/master/CordovaLib/Classes/CDVInvokedUrlCommand.h)

2. [CDVPluginResult.h](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/blob/master/CordovaLib/Classes/CDVPluginResult.h)

3. [CDVCommandDelegate.h](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/blob/master/CordovaLib/Classes/CDVCommandDelegate.h)

## iOS CDVPluginResult message types

Using CDVPluginResult you can return a variety of result types back to your JavaScript callbacks, using class methods that look like:

    + (CDVPluginResult*)resultWithStatus:(CDVCommandStatus)statusOrdinal messageAs...

You can create `String`, `Int`, `Double`, `Bool`, `Array`,
`Dictionary`, `ArrayBuffer`, and `Multipart` types.  Or, don't attach
any arguments (just send a status).  Or, return an Error.  You can
even choose to not send any plugin result at all, in which case the
callback does not fire.

### Notes

 * `messageAsArrayBuffer` expects `NSData*` and converts to an `ArrayBuffer` for your JavaScript callback (and `ArrayBuffers` sent to a plugin from JavaScript are converted to `NSData*`).
 * `messageAsMultipart` expects an `NSArray*` containing any of the other supported types, and sends the whole array as the `arguments` to your JavaScript callback.
   *  Quirk: this is not just syntactic sugar (though it is sweet).  This way, all of the arguments are serialized or deserialized as necessary.  E.g., it is safe to return `NSData*` as multipart, but not as `Array`/`Dictionary`.

## Echo Plugin iOS Plugin

We would add the following to the project's `config.xml` file:

    <feature name="Echo">
        <param name="ios-package" value="Echo" />
    </feature>

Then we would add the following files (`Echo.h` and `Echo.m`) to the Plugins folder inside our Cordova-iOS
application folder:

    /********* Echo.h Cordova Plugin Header *******/

    #import <Cordova/CDV.h>

    @interface Echo : CDVPlugin

    - (void)echo:(CDVInvokedUrlCommand*)command;

    @end

    /********* Echo.m Cordova Plugin Implementation *******/

    #import "Echo.h"
    #import <Cordova/CDV.h>

    @implementation Echo

    - (void)echo:(CDVInvokedUrlCommand*)command
    {
        CDVPluginResult* pluginResult = nil;
        NSString* echo = [command.arguments objectAtIndex:0];

        if (echo != nil && [echo length] > 0) {
            pluginResult = [CDVPluginResult resultWithStatus:CDVCommandStatus_OK messageAsString:echo];
        } else {
            pluginResult = [CDVPluginResult resultWithStatus:CDVCommandStatus_ERROR];
        }

        [self.commandDelegate sendPluginResult:pluginResult callbackId:command.callbackId];
    }

    @end

Let's take a look at the code. At the top we have all of the necessary
Cordova imports. Our class extends from `CDVPlugin` (very important).

This plugin only supports one action, the `echo` action. First, we
grab the echo string using the `objectAtIndex` method on our `args`,
telling it we want to get the 0th parameter in the arguments array. We
do a bit of parameter checking: make sure it is not `nil`, and make
sure it is not a zero-length string.

If it is, we return a `PluginResult` with an `ERROR` status. If all of
those checks pass, then we return a `PluginResult` with an `OK`
status, and pass in the `echo` string we received in the first place
as a parameter.

Finally, we send the result to `self.commandDelegate`, which executes
the `exec` method's success or failure callbacks on the JavaScript
side. If the success callback is called, it passes in the `echo`
parameter.

## Threading

Plugin methods are executed in the same thread as the UI. If your
plugin requires a great deal of processing or requires a blocking
call, you should use a background thread. For example:

    - (void)myPluginMethod:(CDVInvokedUrlCommand*)command
    {
        // Check command.arguments here.
        [self.commandDelegate runInBackground:^{
            NSString* payload = nil;
            // Some blocking logic...
            CDVPluginResult* pluginResult = [CDVPluginResult resultWithStatus:CDVCommandStatus_OK messageAsString:payload];
            // The sendPluginResult method is thread-safe.
            [self.commandDelegate sendPluginResult:pluginResult callbackId:command.callbackId];
        }];
    }

## Advanced Plugin Functionality

See other methods that you can override in:

* [CDVPlugin.h](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/blob/master/CordovaLib/Classes/CDVPlugin.h)

* [CDVPlugin.m](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/blob/master/CordovaLib/Classes/CDVPlugin.m)

For example, you can hook into the `pause`, `resume`, app terminate and `handleOpenURL` events.

## Debugging Plugins

To debug the Objective-C side, you would use Xcode's built-in debugger.
For JavaScript, on iOS 5.0 you can use
[Weinre, an Apache Cordova Project](https://github.com/apache/cordova-weinre) or
[iWebInspector, a third-party utility](http://www.iwebinspector.com/)

For iOS 6, you would use Safari 6.0 to simply attach to your app
running in the iOS 6 Simulator.

## Common Pitfalls

* Don't forget to add your plugin's mapping to config.xml. If you forget, an error is logged in the Xcode console.

* Don't forget to add any hosts you connect to in the whitelist, as described in Domain Whitelist Guide. If you forget, an error is logged in the Xcode console.
