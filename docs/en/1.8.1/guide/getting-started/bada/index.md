Getting Started with Bada
=========================

This guide describes how to set up your development environment for Cordova and run a sample application.  Note that Cordova used to be called PhoneGap, so some of the sites still use the old PhoneGap name.

1. Requirements
---------------

- Windows
- You need the bada 1.2 SDK to use cordova-bada (which is no longer available on Samsung&apos;s website)

2. Install SDK + Cordova
-------------------------

- Download and install the [Bada SDK](http://developer.bada.com) (Windows only). 
- Download the latest copy of [Cordova](http://phonegap.com/download) and extract its contents. We will be working with the bada directory.


3. Setup New Project
--------------------
- In Bada IDE, select _File_ -> Import project -> Bada C++ / Flash Project. 
    - Note: Bada 1.2 select "Bada Application Project"

- Make sure "Select root directory is checked" and then click Browse
- Browse to Cordova bada project folder (bada for 1.2 and bada-wac for 2.x) and select it. Make sure "Copy projects into workspace is checked"

        <script type="text/javascript" src="osp://webapp/js/webapp_core.js"></script>

**Bada 1.2**: Your HTML/CSS/Javascript code lives under the Res/ folder. Make sure your index.html contains the following line.
