# Splashscreen

> Displays and hides the application's splash screen.

## Methods

- splashscreen.show
- splashscreen.hide

## Accessing the Feature

As of version 3.0, Cordova implements device-level APIs as _plugins_.
Use the CLI's `plugin` command, described in The Command-line
Interface, to add or remove this feature for a project:

        $ cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.splashscreen
        $ cordova plugin ls
        [ 'org.apache.cordova.splashscreen' ]
        $ cordova plugin rm org.apache.cordova.splashscreen

These commands apply to all targeted platforms, but modify the
platform-specific configuration settings described below:

* Android (in `app/res/xml/config.xml`)

        <feature name="SplashScreen">
            <param name="android-package" value="org.apache.cordova.splashscreen.SplashScreen" />
        </feature>

* iOS (in `config.xml`)

        <feature name="SplashScreen">
            <param name="ios-package" value="CDVSplashScreen" />
        </feature>

Some platforms may support this feature without requiring any special
configuration.  See _Platform Support_ in the Overview section.

## Setup

### Android

1. Copy the splash screen image into the Android project's `res/drawable` directory. The size for each image should be:

   - xlarge (xhdpi): at least 960 &times; 720
   - large (hdpi): at least 640 &times; 480
   - medium (mdpi): at least 470 &times; 320
   - small (ldpi): at least 426 &times; 320

   You should use a [9-patch image](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/draw9patch.html) for your splash screen.

2. In config.xml, add the following preferences:

        <preference name="splashscreen" value="splash" />
        <preference name="splashScreenDelay" value="10000" />
      
      The first line sets the image to display as the splash screen. If you name your image anything other than `splash.png`, you need to modify this line.
    The second line sets the delay of how long the splashscreen appears in milliseconds. To dismiss the splash screen once the app receives the `deviceready` event, call the `navigator.splashscreen.hide()` method.

### iOS

Copy your splash screen images into the iOS project's
`Resources/splash` directory. Only add the images for the devices you
want to support, such as iPad or iPhone. The size of each image
should be:

- Default-568h@2x~iphone.png (640x1136 pixels)
- Default-Landscape@2x~ipad.png (2048x1496 pixels)
- Default-Landscape~ipad.png (1024x748 pixels)
- Default-Portrait@2x~ipad.png (1536x2008 pixels)
- Default-Portrait~ipad.png (768x1004 pixels)
- Default@2x~iphone.png (640x960 pixels)
- Default~iphone.png (320x480 pixels)

### BlackBerry 10

Copy your splash screen images into the project's
'res/screen/blackberry10' directory. The file names should be:

- splash-1280x768.png (1280x768 pixels)
- splash-720x720.png (720x720 pixels)
- splash-768x1280.png (768x1280 pixels)
