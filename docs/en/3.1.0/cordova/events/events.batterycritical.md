# batterycritical

The event fires when the battery has reached the critical level
threshold.

    window.addEventListener("batterycritical", yourCallbackFunction, false);

## Details

The event fires when the percentage of battery charge has reached the
critical battery threshold. The value is device-specific.

The `batterycritical` handler is passed an object that contains two
properties:

- __level__: The percentage of battery charge (0-100). _(Number)_

- __isPlugged__: A boolean that indicates whether the device is plugged in. _(Boolean)_

Applications typically should use `window.addEventListener` to attach
an event listener once the `deviceready` event fires.

## Supported Platforms

- iOS
- Android
- BlackBerry WebWorks (OS 5.0 and higher)
- Tizen

## Quick Example

    window.addEventListener("batterycritical", onBatteryCritical, false);

    function onBatteryCritical(info) {
        // Handle the battery critical event
        alert("Battery Level Critical " + info.level + "%\nRecharge Soon!");
    }
