## Accessing the Feature

As of version 3.0, Cordova implements battery status and other
device-level APIs as _plugins_. Access to all other events not related
to battery status are enabled by default.  Use the CLI's `plugin`
command, described in The Command-line Interface, to enable or disable
battery events:

        $ cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.battery-status
        $ cordova plugin ls
        [ 'org.apache.cordova.battery-status' ]
        $ cordova plugin rm org.apache.cordova.battery-status

These commands apply to all targeted platforms, but modify the
platform-specific configuration settings described below:

* Android

        (in app/res/xml/config.xml)
        <feature name="Battery">
            <param name="android-package" value="org.apache.cordova.batterystatus.BatteryListener" />
        </feature>

* BlackBerry WebWorks

        (in www/plugins.xml)
        <feature name="Battery">
            <param name="blackberry-package" value="org.apache.cordova.battery.Battery" />
        </feature>

        (in www/config.xml)
        <feature id="blackberry.app"          required="true" version="1.0.0.0" />
        <feature id="blackberry.app.event"    required="true" version="1.0.0.0" />
        <feature id="blackberry.system.event" required="true" version="1.0.0.0" />

* iOS (in `config.xml`)

        <feature name="Battery">
            <param name="ios-package" value="CDVBattery" />
        </feature>

* Tizen (in `config.xml`)

        <feature name="http://tizen.org/api/systeminfo" required="true"/>

configuration.  See _Platform Support_ in the Overview section.
