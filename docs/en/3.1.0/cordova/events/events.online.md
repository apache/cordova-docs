# online

This event fires when an application goes online, and the device
becomes connected to the Internet.

    document.addEventListener("online", yourCallbackFunction, false);

## Details

The `online` event fires when a previously unconnected device receives
a network connection to allow an application access to the Internet.
It relies on the same information as the Connection API, and fires
when the value of `connection.type` changes from `NONE` to any other
value.

Applications typically should use `document.addEventListener` to
attach an event listener once the `deviceready` event fires.

## Supported Platforms

- Android
- BlackBerry WebWorks (OS 5.0 and higher)
- iOS
- Windows Phone 7 and 8
- Tizen
- Windows 8

## Quick Example

    document.addEventListener("online", onOnline, false);

    function onOnline() {
        // Handle the online event
    }

## Full Example

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Online Example</title>

        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="cordova.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">

        // Wait for device API libraries to load
        //
        function onLoad() {
            document.addEventListener("online", onOnline, false);
            document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
        }

        // device APIs are available
        //
        function onDeviceReady() {
        }

        // Handle the online event
        //
        function onOnline() {
        }

        </script>
      </head>
      <body onload="onLoad()">
      </body>
    </html>

## iOS Quirks

During initial startup, the first `online` event (if applicable) takes
at least a second to fire, prior to which `connection.type` is
`UNKNOWN`.

## Windows Phone 7 Quirks

When running in the Emulator, the `connection.status` is always unknown, so this event will _not_ fire.

## Windows Phone 8 Quirks

The Emulator reports the connection type as `Cellular`, which does not change, so events will _not_ fire.
