This object contains attributes of a single file.

## Properties

- __fullPath__: The full path of the file including the file name. _(DOMString)_

- __type__: The mime type of the file. _(DOMString)_

- __lastModifiedDate__: The last time the file was modified. _(Date)_

- __size__: The size of the file in bytes. _(long)_

## Methods

- __slice__: Select only a portion of the file to be read.

## Details

The `File` object contains attributes of a single file.  You can get
an instance of a `File` object by calling a `FileEntry` object's
`file()` method.

## Supported Platforms

- BlackBerry WebWorks (OS 5.0 and higher)
- iOS
- Windows Phone 7 and 8
- Windows 8

## slice

Return a new `File` object, for which `FileReader` returns only the
specified portion of the file.  Negative values for `start` or `end`
are measured from the end of the file.  Indexes are positioned
relative to the current slice. (See the full example below.)

__Parameters:__

- __start__: The index of the first byte to read, inclusive.

- __end__: The index of the byte after the last one to read.

__Quick Example__

    var slicedFile = file.slice(10, 30);

__Full Example__

    var slice1 = file.slice(100, 400);
    var slice2 = slice1.slice(20, 35);

    var slice3 = file.slice(120, 135);
    // slice2 and slice3 are equivalent.
