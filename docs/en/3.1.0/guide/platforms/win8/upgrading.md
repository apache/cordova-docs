# Upgrading Windows 8

This guide shows how to modify Windows 8 projects to upgrade from older versions of Cordova.
Most of these instructions apply to projects created with an older set
of command-line tools that precede the `cordova` CLI utility. See The Command-line Interface for information how to update the
version of the CLI.

## Upgrade to 3.1.0

Cordova CLI support for Windows 8 was introduced in Cordova 3.1.0. To upgrade, we suggest creating a new Cordova CLI project and moving over all necessary assets.  

## Upgrade to 2.9.0 from 2.8.0 ##

The following commands should be done from within Visual Studio to be sure that the any project references are updated/deleted.

1. Remove `cordova-2.8.0.js` from the project's `www` directory.

2. Add `cordova.js` file from the source to the project's `www` directory. (Note that the file no longer contains a version number in the filename.)

3. Build and test!

## Upgrade to 2.8.0 from 2.7.0 ##

The following commands should be done from within Visual Studio to be sure that the any project references are updated/deleted.

1. Remove `cordova-2.7.0.js` from the project's `www` directory. 

2. Add `cordova.js` file from the source to the project's `www` directory. (Note that the file no longer contains a version number in the filename.)

3. Build and test!
