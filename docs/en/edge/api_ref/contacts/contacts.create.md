contacts.create
===============

Returns a new Contact object.

    var contact = navigator.contacts.create(properties);

Description
-----------

The `contacts.create` method is synchronous, and returns a new `Contact` object.

This method does not retain the Contact object in the device contacts
database, for which you need to invoke the `Contact.save` method.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- Android
- BlackBerry WebWorks (OS 5.0 and higher)
- iOS
- Windows Phone 7 and 8

Quick Example
-------------

    var myContact = navigator.contacts.create({"displayName": "Test User"});
