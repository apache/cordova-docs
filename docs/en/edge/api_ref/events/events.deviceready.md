deviceready
===========

The event fires when Cordova is fully loaded.

    document.addEventListener("deviceready", yourCallbackFunction, false);

Details
-------

This event is essential to any application. It signals that Cordova's
device APIs have loaded and are ready to access.

Cordova consists of two code bases: native and JavaScript. While the
native code loads, a custom loading image displays. However,
JavaScript only loads once the DOM loads. This means your web
application may potentially call a Cordova JavaScript function before
the corresponding native code is available.

The `deviceready` event fires once Cordova has fully loaded. Once the
event fires, you can safely make calls to Cordova APIs.  Applications
typically attach an event listener with `document.addEventListener`
once the HTML document's DOM has loaded.

The `deviceready` event behaves somewhat differently from others.  Any
event handler registered after the `deviceready` event fires has its
callback function called immediately.

    function onDeviceReady() {
        // Now safe to use device APIs
    }

Full Example
------------

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Device Ready Example</title>

        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="cordova-x.x.x.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">

        // Wait for device API libraries to load
        //
        function onLoad() {
            document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
        }

        // device APIs are available
        //
        function onDeviceReady() {
            // Now safe to use device APIs
        }
