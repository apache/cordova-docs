batterycritical
===========

This is an event that fires when a Cordova application detects the battery has reached the critical level threshold.

    window.addEventListener("batterycritical", yourCallbackFunction, false);

Details
-------

This event that fires when a Cordova application detects the percentage of battery has reached the critical battery threshold. This value is device specific.

The batterycritical handler will be called with an object that contains two properties:

- __level:__ The percentage of battery (0-100). _(Number)_
- __isPlugged:__ A boolean that represents whether or not the device is plugged in or not. _(Boolean)_

Typically, you will want to attach an event listener with `window.addEventListener` once you receive the Cordova 'deviceready' event.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- iOS
- Android
- BlackBerry WebWorks (OS 5.0 and higher)
- Tizen

Quick Example
-------------

    window.addEventListener("batterycritical", onBatteryCritical, false);

    function onBatteryCritical(info) {
        // Handle the battery critical event
       	alert("Battery Level Critical " + info.level + "%\nRecharge Soon!"); 
    }
