# resume

The event fires when an application is retrieved from the background.

    document.addEventListener("resume", yourCallbackFunction, false);

## Details

The `resume` event fires when the native platform pulls the
application out from the background.

Applications typically should use `document.addEventListener` to
attach an event listener once the `deviceready` event fires.

## Supported Platforms

- Amazon Fire OS
- Android
- BlackBerry WebWorks 5.0+
- iOS
- Windows Phone 7 and 8
- Windows 8

## Quick Example

    document.addEventListener("resume", onResume, false);

    function onResume() {
        // Handle the resume event
    }

## Full Example

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Resume Example</title>

        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="cordova.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">

        // Wait for device API libraries to load
        //
        function onLoad() {
            document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
        }

        // device APIs are available
        //
        function onDeviceReady() {
            document.addEventListener("resume", onResume, false);
        }

        // Handle the resume event
        //
        function onResume() {
        }

        </script>
      </head>
      <body onload="onLoad()">
      </body>
    </html>

## iOS Quirks

Any interactive functions called from a `pause` event handler execute
later when the app resumes, as signaled by the `resume` event. These
include alerts, `console.log()`, and any calls from plugins or the
Cordova API, which go through Objective-C.

- __active__ event

    The iOS-specific `active` event is available as an alternative to
`resume`, and detects when users disable the __Lock__ button to unlock
the device with the app running in the foreground.  If the app (and
device) is enabled for multi-tasking, this is paired with a subsequent
`resume` event, but only under iOS 5. In effect, all locked apps in
iOS 5 that have multi-tasking enabled are pushed to the background.
For apps to remain running when locked under iOS 5, disable the app's
multi-tasking by setting [UIApplicationExitsOnSuspend](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/general/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/iPhoneOSKeys.html)
to `YES`. To run when locked on iOS 4, this setting does not matter.
    
- __resume__ event

    When called from a `resume` event handler, interactive functions such
as `alert()` need to be wrapped in a `setTimeout()` call with a
timeout value of zero, or else the app hangs. For example:

        document.addEventListener("resume", onResume, false);
        function onResume() {
           setTimeout(function() {
                  // TODO: do your thing!
                }, 0);
        }
