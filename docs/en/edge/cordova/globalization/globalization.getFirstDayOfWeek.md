# globalization.getFirstDayOfWeek

Returns the first day of the week according to the client's user
preferences and calendar.

    navigator.globalization.getFirstDayOfWeek(successCallback, errorCallback);

## Description

The days of the week are numbered starting from 1, where 1 is assumed
to be Sunday.  Returns the day to the `successCallback` with a
`properties` object as a parameter. That object should have a `value`
property with a `Number` value.

If there is an error obtaining the pattern, then the `errorCallback`
executes with a `GlobalizationError` object as a parameter. The
error's expected code is `GlobalizationError.UNKNOWN\_ERROR`.

## Supported Platforms

- Amazon Fire OS
- Android
- iOS
- Windows Phone 8

## Quick Example

When the browser is set to the `en\_US` locale, this displays a
popup dialog with text similar to `day: 1`.

    navigator.globalization.getFirstDayOfWeek(
        function (day) {alert('day: ' + day.value + '\n');},
        function () {alert('Error getting day\n');}
    );
