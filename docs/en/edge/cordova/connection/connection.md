## Accessing the Feature

As of version 3.0, Cordova implements device-level APIs as _plugins_.
Use the CLI's `plugin` command, described in The Command-line
Interface, to add or remove this feature for a project:

        $ cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.network-information
        $ cordova plugin ls
        [ 'org.apache.cordova.network-information' ]
        $ cordova plugin rm org.apache.cordova.network-information

These commands apply to all targeted platforms, but modify the
platform-specific configuration settings described below:

* Android

        (in app/res/xml/config.xml)
        <feature name="NetworkStatus">
            <param name="android-package" value="org.apache.cordova.networkinformation.NetworkManager" />
        </feature>

        (in app/AndroidManifest.xml)
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />

* BlackBerry WebWorks

        (in www/plugins.xml)
        <feature name="Network Status">

        </feature>
