## Description

This property offers a fast way to determine the device's network
connection state, and type of connection.

- iOS
- Android
- BlackBerry 10
- Tizen
- Windows Phone 7 and 8
- Windows 8

## Quick Example

    function checkConnection() {
        var networkState = navigator.connection.type;

        var states = {};
        states[Connection.UNKNOWN]  = 'Unknown connection';
        states[Connection.ETHERNET] = 'Ethernet connection';
        states[Connection.WIFI]     = 'WiFi connection';
        states[Connection.CELL_2G]  = 'Cell 2G connection';
        states[Connection.CELL_3G]  = 'Cell 3G connection';
        states[Connection.CELL_4G]  = 'Cell 4G connection';
        states[Connection.CELL]     = 'Cell generic connection';
        states[Connection.NONE]     = 'No network connection';

        alert('Connection type: ' + states[networkState]);
    }

    checkConnection();

## API Change

Until Cordova 2.3.0, the `Connection` object was accessed via
`navigator.network.connection`, after which it was changed to
`navigator.connection` to match the W3C specification.  It's still
available at its original location, but is deprecated and will
eventually be removed.

## iOS Quirks

- iOS can't detect the type of cellular network connection.
    - `navigator.connection.type` is set to `Connection.CELL` for all cellular data.

## Windows Phone Quirks

- When running in the emulator, always detects `navigator.connection.type` as `Connection.UNKNOWN`.

- Windows Phone can't detect the type of cellular network connection.
    - `navigator.connection.type` is set to `Connection.CELL` for all cellular data.

## Tizen Quirks

- Tizen can only detect a WiFi or cellular connection.
    - `navigator.connection.type` is set to `Connection.CELL_2G` for all cellular data.
