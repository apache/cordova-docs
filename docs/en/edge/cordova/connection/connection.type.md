API Change
----------
Before Cordova 2.3.0, the Connection object existed at: `navigator.network.connection`.

To match the spec, this was changed to `navigator.connection` in 2.3.0.

`navigator.network.connection` still exists, but is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

iOS Quirks
----------

- iOS cannot detect the type of cellular network connection.
    - `navigator.connection.type` is set to `Connection.CELL_2G` for all cellular data.  This is deprecated as of 2.6.0 and will be changed to return `Connection.CELL` in a future release.

Bada Quirks
-----------

- Bada can only detect a WiFi or cellular connection.
    - `navigator.connection.type` is set to `Connection.CELL_2G` for all cellular data.

webOS Quirks
------------

- Only shows that a connection is available, but not which type.

Windows Phone Quirks
--------------------

- When running in the emulator, always detects `navigator.connection.type` as `Connection.UNKNOWN`.
- Windows Phone cannot detect the type of cellular network connection.
    - `navigator.connection.type` is set to `Connection.CELL` for all cellular data.

Tizen Quirks
--------------------

- Tizen can only detect a WiFi or cellular connection.
    - `navigator.connection.type` is set to `Connection.CELL_2G` for all cellular data.
