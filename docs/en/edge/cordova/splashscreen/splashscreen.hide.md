splashscreen.hide
===============

Dismiss the splash screen.

    navigator.splashscreen.hide();

Description
-----------

This method dismisses the application's splash screen.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- Android
- BlackBerry 10
- iOS
- Windows Phone 7 and 8
- Windows 8

Quick Example
-------------

    navigator.splashscreen.hide();

Full Example
------------

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Splashscreen Example</title>

        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="cordova.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">

        // Wait for device API libraries to load
        //
        document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

        // device APIs are available
        //
        function onDeviceReady() {
            navigator.splashscreen.hide();
        }

        </script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Example</h1>
      </body>
    </html>

iOS Quirk
------------

The `config.xml` file's `AutoHideSplashScreen` setting must be
`false`. To delay hiding the splash screen for two seconds, add a
timer such as the following in the `deviceready` event handler:

        setTimeout(function() {
            navigator.splashscreen.hide();
        }, 2000);
