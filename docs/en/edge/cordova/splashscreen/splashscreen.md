Splashscreen
==========

> Displays and hides the application's splash screen.

Methods
-------

- splashscreen.show
- splashscreen.hide

## Accessing the Feature

As of version 3.0, Cordova implements device-level APIs as _plugins_.
Use the CLI's `plugin` command, described in The Command-line
Interface, to add or remove this feature for a project:

        $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-splashscreen.git
        $ cordova plugin rm org.apache.cordova.core.splashscreen

These commands apply to all targeted platforms, but modify the
platform-specific configuration settings described below:

* Android (in `app/res/xml/config.xml`)

        <feature name="SplashScreen">
            <param name="android-package" value="org.apache.cordova.SplashScreen" />
        </feature>

* iOS (in `config.xml`)

        <feature name="SplashScreen">
            <param name="ios-package" value="CDVSplashScreen" />
        </feature>

Setup
-----

### Android

1. Copy the splash screen image into the Android project's `res/drawable` directory. The size for each image should be:

   - xlarge (xhdpi): at least 960 &times; 720
   - large (hdpi): at least 640 &times; 480
   - medium (mdpi): at least 470 &times; 320
   - small (ldpi): at least 426 &times; 320

   You should use a [9-patch image](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/draw9patch.html) for your splash screen.

2. In the `onCreate` method of the class that extends `DroidGap`, add the following two lines:

        super.setIntegerProperty("splashscreen", R.drawable.splash);
        super.loadUrl(Config.getStartUrl(), 10000);

    The first line sets the image to display as the splashscreen. If you name your image anything other than `splash.png`, you need to modify this line.
    The second line is the normal `super.loadUrl` line, but it has a second parameter that specifies a timeout value for the splash screen. In this example the splash screen displays for 10 seconds. To dismiss the splash screen once the app receives the `deviceready` event, call the `navigator.splashscreen.hide()` method.

### iOS

Copy your splash screen images into the iOS project's
`Resources/splash` directory. Only add the images for the devices you
want to support, such as iPad or iPhone. The size of each image
should be:

- Default-568h@2x~iphone.png (640x1136 pixels)
- Default-Landscape@2x~ipad.png (2048x1496 pixels)
- Default-Landscape~ipad.png (1024x748 pixels)
- Default-Portrait@2x~ipad.png (1536x2008 pixels)
- Default-Portrait~ipad.png (768x1004 pixels)
- Default@2x~iphone.png (640x960 pixels)
- Default~iphone.png (320x480 pixels)
