## Full Example

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Splashscreen Example</title>

        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="cordova.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">

        // Wait for device API libraries to load
        //
        document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

        // device APIs are available
        //
        function onDeviceReady() {
            navigator.splashscreen.show();
        }

      </head>

      </body>

Your application can not call `navigator.splashscreen.show()` until
the app has started and the `deviceready` event has fired. But since
typically the
splash screen is meant to be visible before your app has started, that would
seem to defeat the purpose of the splash screen.
Providing some configuration in `config.xml` will automatically `show` the
splash screen immediately after your app launch and before it has fully
started and received the `deviceready` event. See Icons and Splash Screens
for more information on doing this configuration. For this reason, it is
unlikely you need to call `navigator.splashscreen.show()` to make the
splash screen visible for app startup.
