DirectoryEntry
==============

This object represents a directory on a file system, as defined by the
[W3C Directories and Systems](http://www.w3.org/TR/file-system-api/)
specification.

----------

- __isFile__: Always `false`. _(boolean)_

- __isDirectory__: Always `true`. _(boolean)_

- __name__: The name of the `DirectoryEntry`, excluding the path leading to it. _(DOMString)_

- __fullPath__: The full absolute path from the root to the `DirectoryEntry`. _(DOMString)_

__NOTE:__ The following attribute is defined by the W3C specification,
but is _not_ supported:

Methods
-------

The following methods can be invoked on a `DirectoryEntry` object:

- __getMetadata__: Look up metadata about a directory.

- __setMetadata__: Set metadata on a directory.

- __moveTo__: Move a directory to a different location on the file system.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- Android
- BlackBerry WebWorks (OS 5.0 and higher)
- iOS
- Windows Phone 7 and 8
- Windows 8

getMetadata
-----------

Look up metadata about a directory.

__Parameters:__

- __successCallback__: A callback function to execute with a `Metadata` object. _(Function)_

- __errorCallback__: A callback function to execute if an error occurs when retrieving the `Metadata`. Invoked with a `FileError` object. _(Function)_

__Quick Example__

    function success(metadata) {
        console.log("Last Modified: " + metadata.modificationTime);
    }

    function fail(error) {
        alert(error.code);
    }

    // Request the metadata object for this entry
    entry.getMetadata(success, fail);

setMetadata
----------------

Sets a directory's extended attributes, or metadata. _Currently works
only on iOS._

__Parameters:__

- __successCallback__: A callback that executes when the metadata is successfully set. _(Function)_

- __errorCallback__: A callback that executes when the metadata fails to be set. _(Function)_

- __metadataObject__: An object that contains the metadata's keys and values. _(Object)_

__Quick Example__

    function success() {
        console.log("The metadata was successfully set.");
    }

    function fail() {
        alert("There was an error in setting the metadata");
    }

    // Set the metadata
    entry.setMetadata(success, fail, { "com.apple.MobileBackup": 1});

__iOS Quirk__

- Only the `com.apple.MobileBackup` extended attribute is supported. Set the value to `1` to prevent the directory from being backed up to iCloud. Set the value to `0` to re-enable the directory to be backed up to iCloud.

__Quick Example__

    function setFolderMetadata(localFileSystem, subFolder, metadataKey, metadataValue)
    {
        var onSetMetadataWin = function() {
            console.log("success setting metadata")
        }
        var onSetMetadataFail = function() {
            console.log("error setting metadata")
        }

        var onGetDirectoryWin = function(parent) {
            var data = {};
            data[metadataKey] = metadataValue;
            parent.setMetadata(onSetMetadataWin, onSetMetadataFail, data);
        }
        var onGetDirectoryFail = function() {
            console.log("error getting dir")
        }

        var onFSWin = function(fileSystem) {
            fileSystem.root.getDirectory(subFolder, {create: true, exclusive: false}, onGetDirectoryWin, onGetDirectoryFail);
        }

        var onFSFail = function(evt) {
            console.log(evt.target.error.code);
        }

        window.requestFileSystem(localFileSystem, 0, onFSWin, onFSFail);
    }

        setFolderMetadata(LocalFileSystem.PERSISTENT, "Backups", "com.apple.MobileBackup", 1);

moveTo
------

Move a directory to a different location on the file system. An error results if the app attempts to:

- move a directory inside itself or to any child at any depth.

- move a directory into its parent if a name different from its current directory is not provided.

- move a directory to a path occupied by a file.

- move a directory to a path occupied by a directory that is not empty.

Moving a directory on top of an existing empty directory attempts to
delete and replace that directory.

__Parameters:__

- __parent__: The parent directory to which to move the directory. _(DirectoryEntry)_

- __newName__: The new name of the directory. Defaults to the current name if unspecified. _(DOMString)_

- __successCallback__: A callback that executes with the `DirectoryEntry` object for the new directory. _(Function)_

- __errorCallback__: A callback that executes if an error occurs when attempting to move the directory. Invoked with a `FileError` object. _(Function)_

__Quick Example__

    function success(entry) {
        console.log("New Path: " + entry.fullPath);
    }

    function fail(error) {
        alert(error.code);
    }

    function moveDir(entry) {
        var parent = document.getElementById('parent').value,
            parentName = parent.substring(parent.lastIndexOf('/')+1),
            newName = document.getElementById('newName').value,
            parentEntry = new DirectoryEntry(parentName, parent);

        // move the directory to a new directory and rename it
        entry.moveTo(parentEntry, newName, success, fail);
    }

copyTo
------

Copy a directory to a different location on the file system.  An error results if the app attempts to:

- copy a directory inside itself at any depth.

- copy a directory into its parent if a name different from its current directory is not provided.

Directory copies are always recursive, and copy all contents of the directory.

__Parameters:__

- __parent__: The parent directory to which to copy the directory. _(DirectoryEntry)_

- __newName__: The new name of the directory. Defaults to the current name if unspecified. _(DOMString)_

- __successCallback__: A callback that executes with the `DirectoryEntry` object for the new directory. _(Function)_

- __errorCallback__: A callback that executes if an error occurs when attempting to copy the underlying directory. Invoked with a `FileError` object. _(Function)_

__Quick Example__

    function win(entry) {
        console.log("New Path: " + entry.fullPath);
    }

    function fail(error) {
        alert(error.code);
    }

    function copyDir(entry) {
        var parent = document.getElementById('parent').value,
            parentName = parent.substring(parent.lastIndexOf('/')+1),
            newName = document.getElementById('newName').value,
            parentEntry = new DirectoryEntry(parentName, parent);

        // copy the directory to a new directory and rename it
        entry.copyTo(parentEntry, newName, success, fail);
    }

toURL
-----

Returns a URL that can be used to locate the directory.

__Quick Example__

    // Get the URL for this directory
    var dirURL = entry.toURL();
    console.log(dirURL);

remove
------

Deletes a directory. An error results if the app attempts to:

- delete a directory that is not empty.

- delete the root directory of a filesystem.

__Parameters:__

- __successCallback__: A callback that executes after the directory is deleted.  Invoked with no parameters. _(Function)_

- __errorCallback__: A callback that executes if an error occurs when attempting to delete the directory. Invoked with a `FileError` object. _(Function)_

    entry.getFile("newFile.txt", {create: true, exclusive: false}, success, fail);

removeRecursively
-----------------

Deletes a directory and all of its contents.  In the event of an error (such as trying to delete
a directory containing a file that cannot be removed), some of the contents of the directory may
be deleted.   An error results if the app attempts to:

    }

    // remove the directory and all it's contents
    entry.removeRecursively(success, fail);

BlackBerry Quirks
-----------------

May fail with a `ControlledAccessException` in the following cases:

- An app attempts to access a directory created by a previous installation of the app.

> Solution: ensure temporary directories are cleaned manually, or by the application prior to reinstallation.

- If the device is connected by USB.

> Solution: disconnect the USB cable from the device and run again.
