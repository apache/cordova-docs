capture.captureVideo
====================

> Start the video recorder application and return information about captured video clip file(s).

    navigator.device.capture.captureVideo(
        CaptureCB captureSuccess, CaptureErrorCB captureError, [CaptureVideoOptions options]
    );

Description
-----------

Starts an asynchronous operation to capture video recordings using the
device's video recording application.  The operation allows the user
to capture more than one recordings in a single session.

The capture operation ends when either the user exits the video
recording application, or the maximum number of recordings specified
by `CaptureVideoOptions.limit` is reached.  If no `limit` parameter
value is specified, it defaults to one (1), and the capture operation
terminates after the user records a single video clip.

When the capture operation finishes, it the `CaptureCB` callback
executes with an array of `MediaFile` objects describing each captured
video clip file.  If the user terminates the operation before
capturing a video clip, the `CaptureErrorCB` callback executes with a
`CaptureError` object featuring a
`CaptureError.CAPTURE_NO_MEDIA_FILES` error code.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- Android
- BlackBerry WebWorks (OS 5.0 and higher)
- iOS
- Windows Phone 7 and 8
- Bada 2.x
- Windows 8

Quick Example
-------------

    // capture callback
    var captureSuccess = function(mediaFiles) {
        var i, path, len;
        for (i = 0, len = mediaFiles.length; i < len; i += 1) {
            path = mediaFiles[i].fullPath;
            // do something interesting with the file
        }
    };

    // capture error callback
    var captureError = function(error) {
        navigator.notification.alert('Error code: ' + error.code, null, 'Capture Error');
    };

    // start video capture
    navigator.device.capture.captureVideo(captureSuccess, captureError, {limit:2});

BlackBerry WebWorks Quirks
--------------------------

- Cordova for BlackBerry WebWorks attempts to launch the __Video Recorder__ application, provided by RIM, to capture video recordings. The app receives a `CaptureError.CAPTURE_NOT_SUPPORTED` error code if the application is not installed on the device.

Bada 2.x Quirks
---------------

Bada supports `captureVideo` just like the other platforms, but
features _another_ mode allowing video or image capture straight into
the WebView without launching any camera app. Here's how:

1. Create an element with an `id` attribute somewhere in the HTML:

        <div id="preview"></div>

2. Initialize the camera preview as follows:

        navigator.camera.showPreview("preview");

3. Once the preview is available, use code such as this to start capturing a video:

        navigator.capture.startVideoCapture(success, fail, {duration: 5000, destinationFilename: "videos/a.3gp"});

4. Use this to stop the video capture:

        navigator.capture.stopVideoCapture();

5. Dismiss the camera preview as follows:

        navigator.camera.hidePreview("preview");
