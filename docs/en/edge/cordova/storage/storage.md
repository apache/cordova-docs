Storage
==========

> Provides access to the device's storage options.

This API is based on the [W3C Web SQL Database
Specification](http://dev.w3.org/html5/webdatabase/) and [W3C Web
Storage API Specification](http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/). Some
devices already provide an implementation of these specifications, in
which case the built-in support applies.  Cordova's implementation
offers compatible support for those that don't.
