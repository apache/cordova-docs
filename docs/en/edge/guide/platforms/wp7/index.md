Windows Phone 7 Platform Guide
==================================

## Requirements and Support

Requires Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows Vista with SP2.  Running
Windows as a virtual machine does not work well, so Mac users should
set up a Bootcamp partition to run Windows 7 or Vista.

To install the app onto a device or submit it to the market place, you
need to become an
[App Hub member](http://create.msdn.com/en-US/home/membership).

Developers should use the the `cordova` utility in conjunction with
the Windows Phone SDK.  Before installing it on Windows, open a
command line and type `git` to make sure it is installed. If not,
download it from [mysysgit.github.io](http://mysysgit.github.io). When
prompted to configure your PATH, choose the option: __Run Git and
included Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt__. Once git is
available, follow the instructions in The Cordova Command-line
Interface for information how to install it, add projects, then build
and deploy a project.

## Install the SDK

Download and install the
[Windows Phone SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=27570/)

## Open a Project in the SDK

After installing the `cordova` utility, use the following to create a
new project, then add and build the Windows Phone 7 project.

        $ cordova create hello com.example.hello "Hello World"
        $ cd hello
        $ cordova platform add wp7
        $ cordova build

Open Visual Studio and choose __Open Project__. Navigate to the
`hello/platforms/wp7` directory and choose the `Hello_World.sln` file.
The SDK displays the directory's contents:

At this point you can modify the app within the SDK, but running the
`build` or `prepare` commands again wipes out local changes. If Visual
Studio is open, it alerts you about modified files and offers you the
option to reload them.  See The Cordova Command-line Interface for
more information.

## Deploy to Emulator

Within the SDK, select the __Windows Phone Emulator__ target from the
popup menu in the main menu bar, and press the green button to run the
emulator:

The app displays on the emulator's home screen as it would on a real
device:

## Deploy to Device

To test your application on a device, the device must be registered.
MSDN provides
[documentation][http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff402565(v=vs.105).aspx]
to help deploy and test your Windows Phone.

Once registered, you need to make sure the phone is connected via USB
with its screen unlocked. In Visual Studio, choose the __Windows Phone
Device__ target and press the green button to run it:
