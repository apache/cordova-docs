# Upgrading Windows Phone

This guide shows how to modify Windows Phone projects, both versions 7
and 8, to upgrade from older versions of Cordova.  Most of these
instructions apply to projects created with an older set of
command-line tools that precede the `cordova` CLI utility. See The
Command-line Interface for information how to update the version of
the CLI.  The following section shows how to upgrade from non-CLI
projects.

## Upgrade to the CLI (3.0.0) from 2.9.0 ##

1. Create a new Apache Cordova 3.0.0 project using the cordova CLI, as
   described in The Command-line Interface.

2. Add your platforms the the cordova project, for example: `cordova
   platform add wp7 wp8`.

3. Copy the contents of the project's `www` directory to the `www` directory
   at the root of the cordova project you just created.

4. Copy or overwrite any native assets from your original project
   (`SplashScreen`, `ApplicationIcon`, etc.), making sure to add any
   new files to the `.csproj` file. The windows phone project builds
   inside the `platforms\wp7` or `platforms\wp8` directory.

5. Use the cordova CLI tool to install any plugins you need. Note that
   the CLI handles all core APIs as plugins, so they may need to be
   added. Only 3.0.0 plugins are compatible with the CLI.

6. Build and test.

## Upgrade to 3.0.0 (non-CLI) from 2.9.0 ##

In Visual Studio's Solution Explorer window:

1. Create a new Apache Cordova WP7 or WP8 3.0.0 Project.

2. Copy the contents of your `www` directory to the new project, and be sure these items are added to the VS project.

3. Copy and overwrite any splash screen, or icon images.

4. Copy over any plugins from the `plugins` directory to the new project and ensure that they are also added to the VS project. 

5. Build and test.

__NOTE:__ all core APIs are removed from Cordova version 3.0, and must
be installed separately as plugins.  For more information on how to
re-enable these features in a non-CLI workflow, see Using Plugman to
Manage Plugins.

## Upgrade to 2.9.0 from 2.8.0 ##

In Visual Studio's Solution Explorer window:

1. Create a new Apache Cordova WP7 or WP8 2.9.0 Project.

2. Copy the contents of your `www` directory to the new project, and be sure these items are added to the VS project.

3. Update the name of `cordova.js` in the HTML tag if it's still using cordova-VERSION.js (should be just `cordova.js`).

4. Copy and overwrite any splash screen, or icon images.

5. Copy over any plugins from the `plugins` directory to the new project and ensure that they are also added to the .csproj file.

6. Build and test.

## Upgrade to 2.8.0 from 2.7.0 ##

In Visual Studio's Solution Explorer window:

1. Create a new Apache Cordova WP7 or WP8 2.8.0 Project.
