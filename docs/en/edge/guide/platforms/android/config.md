Android Configuration
===================================

The `config.xml` settings file controls various settings of Cordova. This is application wide, and not set per CordovaWebView Instance.

## &lt;preference&gt;

Various **other** preferences (as **&lt;preference&gt;** tags) default on not breaking existing apps. The available preferences are:

1. **useBrowserHistory (boolean, defaults to true)** - set to false if you want to use the history shim that was used to work around the hashtag error present in Android 3.x prior to the history fix.  (Note: This setting will be deprecated in April 2013)
2. **loadingDialog** - Display a native loading dialog when loading the app. The value's format is _Title, Message_
3. **loadingPageDialog** - Display a native loading dialog when loading sub-pages. The value's format is _Title, Message_
4. **errorUrl** - Set the error page for your application. Should be located in your Android project in file://android_asset/www/
5. **backgroundColor** - Set the background color for your application.  Supports a four-byte hex value, with the first byte representing alpha value, and the following three bytes with standard RGB values. (i.e. 0x00000000 = Black)
6. **loadUrlTimeoutValue** - How much time Cordova should wait before throwing a timeout error on the application.
7. **keepRunning (boolean, defaults to true)** - Determines whether Cordova will keep running in the background or not
8. **splashscreen** - The name of the file minus its extension in the res/drawable directory.  If you have multiple assets, they all must share this common name in their respective directories.
9. **disallowOverscroll (boolean, defaults to false)** - set to true if you want to disable the glow when a user scrolls beyond the edge of the webview.

## &lt;plugin&gt;

Android supports using &lt;feature&gt; as analogues to &lt;plugin&gt; elements.
