# Android WebViews

Beginning in Cordova 1.9, with the assistance of the
`CordovaActivity`, you can use Cordova as a component in a larger
native Android application. Android refers to this component as the
`CordovaWebView`. New Cordova-based applications from 1.9 onwards use
the `CordovaWebView` as its main view, regardless of whether the
legacy `DroidGap` approach is used.

If you're unfamiliar with Android application development, please read
the Android Platform Guide to developing a Cordova Application before
attempting to include a WebView. It's not the main way to author
Android Cordova applications. These instructions are currently manual,
but may be eventually be automated.

## Prerequisites

1. Cordova 1.9 or greater

2. Android SDK updated with 15

## Guide to using CordovaWebView in an Android Project

1. Use `bin/create` to fetch the `commons-codec-1.6.jar` file.

2. `cd` into `/framework` and run `ant jar` to build the cordova jar. It creates the .jar file formed as `cordova-x.x.x.jar` in the `/framework` directory.

3. Copy the cordova jar into your Android project's `/libs` directory.

4. Edit your application's `main.xml` file (under `/res/xml`) to look like the following, with the `layout_height`, `layout_width` and `id` modified to suit your application:

        <org.apache.cordova.CordovaWebView
            android:id="@+id/tutorialView"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent" />

5. Modify your activity so that it implements the `CordovaInterface`.  You should implement the included methods.  You may wish to copy them from `/framework/src/org/apache/cordova/DroidGap.java`, or implement them on your own.  The code fragment below shows a basic application that uses the interface. Note how the referenced view id matches the `id` attribute specified in the XML fragment shown above:

        public class CordovaViewTestActivity extends Activity implements CordovaInterface {
            CordovaWebView cwv;
            /* Called when the activity is first created. */
            @Override
            public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
                super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
                setContentView(R.layout.main);
                cwv = (CordovaWebView) findViewById(R.id.tutorialView);
                Config.init(this);
                cwv.loadUrl(Config.getStartUrl());
            }

        If you use the camera, you should also implement this:

    @Override
    public void setActivityResultCallback(CordovaPlugin plugin) {
        this.activityResultCallback = plugin;
    }
    /**
     * Launch an activity for which you would like a result when it finished. When this activity exits,
     * your onActivityResult() method is called.
     *
     * @param command           The command object
     * @param intent            The intent to start
     * @param requestCode       The request code that is passed to callback to identify the activity
     */
    public void startActivityForResult(CordovaPlugin command, Intent intent, int requestCode) {
        this.activityResultCallback = command;
        this.activityResultKeepRunning = this.keepRunning;
        
        // If multitasking turned on, then disable it for activities that return results
        if (command != null) {
            this.keepRunning = false;
        }
        
        // Start activity
        super.startActivityForResult(intent, requestCode);
    }
    
    @Override
    /**
     * Called when an activity you launched exits, giving you the requestCode you started it with,
     * the resultCode it returned, and any additional data from it.
     *
     * @param requestCode       The request code originally supplied to startActivityForResult(),
     *                          allowing you to identify who this result came from.
     * @param resultCode        The integer result code returned by the child activity through its setResult().
     * @param data              An Intent, which can return result data to the caller (various data can be attached to Intent "extras").
     */
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, intent);
        CordovaPlugin callback = this.activityResultCallback;
        if (callback != null) {
            callback.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, intent);
        }
    }

        Finally, remember to add the thread pool, otherwise the plugins have no threads to run on:

    @Override
    public ExecutorService getThreadPool() {
        return threadPool;
    }

6. Copy your application's HTML and JavaScript files to your Android project's `/assets/www` directory.

7. Copy `cordova.xml` and `plugins.xml` from `/framework/res/xml` to your project's `/res/xml` directory.
