# Android Platform Guide

This guide shows how to set up your SDK environment to deploy Cordova
apps for Android devices, and how to optionally use Android-centered
command-line tools in your development workflow.  You need to install
the Android SDK regardless of whether you want to use these
platform-centered shell tools or cross-platform Cordova CLI for
development. For a comparison of the two development paths, see the
Overview.  For details on the CLI, see The Command-Line Interface.

## Requirements and Support

Cordova for Android requires the Android SDK. See the Android SDK's
[System Requirements](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

Cordova supports Android 2.3.x (Gingerbread, starting with Android API level 10)
and 4.x.  As a general rule, Android versions become unsupported by Cordova as
they dip below 5% on Google's
[distribution dashboard](http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html).
Android versions earlier than API level 10, and the 3.x versions (Honeycomb,
API levels 11-13) fall significantly below that 5% threshold.

## Install Cordova Shell Tools

If you want to use Cordova's Android-centered shell tools in
conjunction with the SDK, download Cordova from
[cordova.apache.org](http://cordova.apache.org). Otherwise ignore this
section if you plan to use the cross-platform CLI tool described in
The Command-Line Interface.

The Cordova download contains separate archives for each platform. Be
sure to expand the appropriate archive, `android` in this case, within
an empty directory.  The relevant executible utilities are available
in the top-level `bin` directory. (Consult the __README__ file if
necessary for more detailed directions.)

These shell tools allow you to create, build, and run Android apps.
For information on the additional command-line interface that enables
plugin features across all platforms, see Using Plugman to Manage
Plugins. See Application Plugins for details on how to develop
plugins.

Install the Android SDK from
[developer.android.com/sdk](http://developer.android.com/sdk/). The android sdk
is distributed as an 'adt-bundle-&lt;os&gt;-&lt;arch&gt;-&lt;ver&gt;' file.
On windows, the adt-bundle is packaged with an installer.
On OSX and Linux, simply unpack the 'adt-bundle' in the location you store development tools. 
[More detailed information on Android SDK setup can be found here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/bundle.html)


For Cordova command-line tools to work, or the CLI that is based upon
them, you need to include the SDK's `tools` and `platform-tools`
directories in your `PATH`.  On a Mac, you can use a text editor to
create or modify the `~/.bash_profile` file, adding a line such as the
following, depending on where the SDK installs:

        export PATH=${PATH}:/Development/adt-bundle/sdk/platform-tools:/Development/adt-bundle/sdk/tools

Add the paths for `java` and `ant` if needed. This line in `~/.bash_profile`
exposes these tools in newly opened terminal windows. If your terminal
window is already open in OSX, or to avoid a logout/login on Linux, run
this to make them available in the current terminal window:

        $ source ~/.bash_profile

To modify the `PATH` environment on Windows 7:

1. Click on the __Start__ menu in the lower-left corner of the desktop,
   right-click on __Computer__, then select __Properties__.

1. Select __Advanced System Settings__ in the column on the left.

1. In the resulting dialog box, press __Environment Variables__.

1. Select the __PATH__ variable and press __Edit__.

1. Append the following to the `PATH` based on where you installed the
   SDK, for example:

        ;C:\Development\adt-bundle\sdk\platform-tools;C:\Development\adt-bundle\sdk\tools

1. Save the value and close both dialog boxes.

You may also need to enable Java and Ant. Open a command prompt and
type `java`, and also type `ant`. Append to the `PATH` whichever of
these fails to run:

        ;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%ANT_HOME%\bin

## Open a New Project in the SDK

At this point, to create a new project you can choose between the
cross-platform CLI tool described in The Command-Line Interface, or
the set of Android-specific shell tools. From within a source-code
directory, here's the CLI approach:

        $ cordova create hello com.example.hello HelloWorld
        $ cd hello
        $ cordova platform add android
        $ cordova build

Here's the corresponding lower-level shell-tool approach for both Unix
and Windows:

        $ /path/to/cordova-android/bin/create /path/to/new/hello com.example.hello HelloWorld
        C:\path\to\cordova-android\bin\create.bat C:\path\to\new\hello com.example.hello HelloWorld

Here's how to use the SDK to modify it:

1. Launch the __Eclipse__ application.

1. Select the __New Project__ menu item.

1. Choose __Android Project from Existing Code__ from the resulting
   dialog box, and press __Next__:

  ![](img/guide/platforms/android/eclipse_new_project.png)

1. If you're using the CLI, navigate to the `hello` directory you
   created for the project, then to the `platforms/android`
   subdirectory. Alternately, if you use the `create` shell utility,
   simply navigate to the `hello` directory.

1. Press __Finish__.

Once the Eclipse window opens, a red __X__ may appear to indicate
unresolved problems. If so, follow these additional steps:

1. Right-click on the project directory.

1. In the resulting __Properties__ dialog, select __Android__ from the navigation pane.

1. For the project build target, select the highest Android API level you have installed.

1. Click __OK__.

1. Select __Clean__ from the __Project__ menu. This should correct all the errors in the project.

## Build the Project

If you are using the CLI in development, the project directory's
top-level `www` directory contains the source files. Run any of
these within the project directory to rebuild the app:

        $ cordova build                   # build all platforms that were added
        $ cordova build android           # build debug for only Android
        $ cordova build android --debug   # build debug for only Android
        $ cordova build android --release # build release for only Android

If you are using the Android-specific shell tools in development,
there is a different approach.  Once you generate the project, the
default app's source is available in the `assets/www` subdirectory.
Subsequent commands are available in its `cordova` subdirectory.

The `build` command cleans project files and rebuilds the app. Here is
the syntax for both Mac and Windows. The first pair of examples
generate debugging information, and the second builds the apps for
release:

        $ /path/to/project/cordova/build --debug
        C:\path\to\project\cordova\build.bat --debug
        
        $ /path/to/project/cordova/build --release
        C:\path\to\project\cordova\build.bat --release

When building for release, if you add the following definitions to your
`local.properties` file, then your APK will get signed and aligned such that
it will be ready for upload to the Google Play store:

        key.store=/Users/me/Developer/mykeystore.jks
        key.alias=mykeyalias

If the keystore and/or the aliased key have a password, the build script will
prompt you for the password. You do not need to define the passwords in a
properties file. If you do want to avoid the prompt, you can define them in 
`local.properties` as `key.store.password` and `key.alias.password`. Be aware
of security concerns with those passwords if you do so.

## Configure an Emulator

You can use either the `cordova` CLI utility or Cordova's
Android-centered shell tools to run an app in an emulator.  Either
way, the SDK must first be configured to display at least one device.
To do so, use the Android SDK Manager, a Java application that runs
separately from Eclipse.  There are two ways to open it:

1. Run `android` on the command line.

1. From within Eclipse, press this toolbar icon:

  ![](img/guide/platforms/android/eclipse_android_sdk_button.png)

Once open, the Android SDK Manager displays various runtime libraries:

![](img/guide/platforms/android/asdk_window.png)

Choose __Tools &rarr; Manage AVDs__ (Android Virtual Devices), then
choose any item from __Device Definitions__ in the resulting dialog
box:

![](img/guide/platforms/android/asdk_device.png)

Press __Create AVD__, optionally modifying the name, then press __OK__
to accept the changes:

![](img/guide/platforms/android/asdk_newAVD.png)

The AVD then appears in the __Android Virtual Devices__ list:

![](img/guide/platforms/android/asdk_avds.png)

To open the emulator as a separate application, select the AVD and
press __Start__. It launches much as it would on the device, with
additional controls available for hardware buttons:

![](img/guide/platforms/android/asdk_emulator.png)

## Deploy to Emulator

At this point you can use the `cordova` CLI utility to deploy the
application to the emulator from the command line:

        $ cordova emulate android

Otherwise use the alternate shell interface:

        $ /path/to/project/cordova/run --emulator

Instead of relying on whichever emulator is currently enabled within
the SDK, you can refer to each by the names you supply:

        $ /path/to/project/cordova/run --target=NAME

This pushes the app to the home screen and launches it:

![](img/guide/platforms/android/emulator2x.png)

When you `run` the app, you also `build` it. You can append additional
`--debug`, `--release`, and `--nobuild` flags to control how it is
built, or even whether a rebuild is necessary:

        $ /path/to/project/cordova/run --emulator --nobuild

If instead you are working within Eclipse, right-click the project and
choose __Run As &rarr; Android Application__. You may be asked to
specify an AVD if none are already open.

For a faster experience, you can use the `Virtual Machine Acceleration` to improve 
the execution speed.
Many modern CPUs provide extensions to execute Virtual Machines more efficiently.
Before attempting to use this type of acceleration, you need to determine if your 
current development system's CPU, supports one the following virtualization technologies:

* __Intel Virtualization Technology__ (VT-x, vmx) &rarr; [Intel VT-x supported processor list](http://ark.intel.com/products/virtualizationtechnology)
* __AMD Virtualization__ (AMD-V, SVM), only supported for Linux (Since May 2006, all CPUs AMD include AMD-V, except Sempron).

Another way to find out if your Intel processor supports VT-x Technology, it's by executing the 
`Intel Processor Identification Utility`, for `Windows`you can download it from the Intel [Download Center](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?ProductID=1881&DwnldID=7838),
or you can use the [booteable utility](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?ProductID=1881&DwnldID=7840&lang=eng), which is `OS Independent`.

After install and execute the `Intel Processor Identification Utility` over Windows, you will get the following window, 
in order to check if your CPU supports the Virtualization Technologies:

![](img/guide/platforms/android/intel_pid_util_620px.png)

In order to speed up the emulator, you need to download and install one or more `Intel x86 Atom` System Images, 
as well as the `Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (HAXM)`.

Open your Android SDK Manager, and select the `Intel x86 Atom` System Image, for whichever version that you want to test. Then go to `Extras` 
and select `Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM)`, and install those packages:

![](img/guide/platforms/android/asdk_man_intel_image_haxm.png)

After download, run the Intel installer, which is available within your
Android SDK at `extras/intel/Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager`. 
__Note__:`If you have any problems installing the package, you can find more information and step by step guidance check this` 
[Intel Article](http://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/speeding-up-the-android-emulator-on-intel-architecture).

1. Install one or more `Intel x86 Atom` System Images as well as the
   `Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager`, available under
   __Extras__.

1. Run the Intel installer, which is available within your Android SDK
   at `extras/intel/Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager`.

1. Create a new AVD with the target set to an Intel image.

1. When starting the emulator, ensure there are no error messages
   indicating a failure to load HAX modules.

## Deploy to Device

To push an app directly to the device, make sure USB debugging is
enabled on your device as described on the
[Android Developer Site](http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html),
and use a mini USB cable to plug it into your system.

You can use this CLI command to push the app to the device:

        $ cordova run android

...or use this Android-centered shell interface:

        $ /path/to/project/cordova/run --device

With no flags specified, the `run` command detects a connected
device, or a currently running emulator if no device is found,
otherwise it prompts to specify an emulator.

To run the app from within Eclipse, right-click the project and choose
__Run As &rarr; Android Application__.

## Other Commands

The following generates a detailed log of the app as it runs:

        $ /path/to/project/cordova/log
        C:\path\to\project\cordova\log.bat

The following cleans the project files:

        $ /path/to/project/cordova/clean
        C:\path\to\project\cordova\clean.bat
