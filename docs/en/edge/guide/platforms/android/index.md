Android Platform Guide
============================

This guide describes how to set up your SDK development environment to
deploy Cordova apps for Android devices.

## Requirements and Support

See the [System Requirements](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
for the Android SDK.

Cordova supports Android 2.2, 2.3, and 4.x.  As a general rule,
platforms are deprecated as they dip below 5% on Google's
[distribution dashboard](http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html).

<!--
NOTE, doc said:
- Android 2.1 (Deprecated May 2013)
- Android 3.x (Deprecated May 2013)
-->

Developers should use the the `cordova` utility in conjunction with
the Android SDK.  See The Cordova Command-line Interface for
information how to install it, add projects, then build and deploy a
project.

## Install the SDK

Install the Android SDK from
[developer.android.com/sdk](http://developer.android.com/sdk/).  You
may be presented with a choice of where to install the SDK, otherwise
move the downloaded `adt-bundle` tree to wherever you store
development tools.

For Cordova command-line tools to work, you need to include the SDK's
`tools` and `platform-tools` directories in your PATH environment.  On
Mac, you can use a text editor to create or modify the
`~/.bash_profile` file, adding a line such as the following, depending
on where the SDK installs:

    export PATH=${PATH}:/Development/adt-bundle/sdk/platform-tools:/Development/adt-bundle/sdk/tools

This exposes SDK tools in newly opened terminal windows. Otherwise run
this to make them available in the current session:

    $ source ~/.bash_profile

To modify the PATH environment on Windows 7:

* Click on the __Start__ menu in the lower-left corner of the desktop,
  right-click on __Computer__, then click __Properties__.

* Click __Advanced System Settings__ in the column on the left.

* In the resulting dialog box, press __Environment Variables__.

* Select the __PATH__ variable and press __Edit__.

* Append the following to the PATH based on where you installed the
  SDK, for example:

        ;C:\Development\adt-bundle\sdk\platform-tools;C:\Development\adt-bundle\sdk\tools

* Save the value and close both dialog boxes.

You may also need to enable Java and Ant. Open a command prompt and
type `java`, and also type `ant`. Append to the PATH whichever fail to
run:

        ;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%ANT_HOME%\bin

## Open a Project in the SDK

Use the `cordova` utility to set up a new project, as described in The
Cordova Command-line Interface. For example, in a source-code directory:

        $ cordova create hello com.example.hello "Hello World"
        $ cd hello
        $ cordova platform add android
        $ cordova build

Once created, here's how to use the SDK to modify it:

* Launch the __Eclipse__ application.
* Select the __New Project__ menu item.
* Choose __Android Project from Existing Code__ from the resulting dialog box, and press __Next__:
    ![](img/guide/platforms/android/eclipse_new_project.png)
* Navigate to `hello`, or whichever directory you created for the project, then to the `platforms/android` subdirectory.
* Press __Finish__.

Once the Eclipse window opens, a red __X__ may appear to indicate
unresolved problems. If so, follow these additional steps:

* Right-click on the project folder.
* In the resulting __Properties__ dialog, select __Android__ from the navigation pane.
* For the project build target, select the highest Android API level you have installed.
* Click __OK__.
* Select __Clean__ from the __Project__ menu. This should correct all the errors in the project.

## Deploy to Emulator

You can use the `cordova` utility to run an app in an emulator, or you
can run it within the SDK.  Either way, the SDK must first be
configured to display at least one device. To do so, use the Android
SDK Manager, a Java application that runs separately from Eclipse.
There are two ways to open it:

* Run `android` on the command line.

* From within Eclipse, press this toolbar icon:

  ![](img/guide/platforms/android/eclipse_android_sdk_button.png)

Once open, the Android SDK Manager displays various runtime libraries:

![](img/guide/platforms/android/asdk_window.png)

Choose __Tools &rarr; Manage AVDs__ (Android Virtual Devices), then
choose any item from __Device Definitions__ in the resulting dialog
box:

![](img/guide/platforms/android/asdk_device.png)

Press __Create AVD__, optionally modifying the name, then press __OK__
to accept the changes:

![](img/guide/platforms/android/asdk_newAVD.png)

The AVD then appears in the __Android Virtual Devices__ list:

![](img/guide/platforms/android/asdk_avds.png)

To open the emulator as a separate application, select the AVD and
press __Start__. It launches much as it would on the device, with
additional controls available for hardware buttons:

![](img/guide/platforms/android/asdk_emulator.png)

At this point you can use the `cordova` utility to deploy the
application to the emulator from the command line:

        $ cordova emulate android

If instead you are working within Eclipse, right-click the project and
choose __Run As &rarr; Android Application__. You may be asked to
specify an AVD if none are already open.

For a faster experience, use an Intel-based emulator image:

* Install one or more `Intel x86 Atom` System Images as well as the
  `Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager`, available under
  __Extras__.
* Run the Intel installer, which is available within your Android SDK
  at `extras/intel/Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager`.
* Create a new AVD with the target set to an Intel image.
* When starting the emulator, ensure there are no error messages
  indicating a failure to load HAX modules.

## Deploy to Device

To push an app directly to the device, make sure USB debugging is
enabled on your device as described on the
[Android Developer Site](http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html),
and use a mini USB cable to plug it into your system.

You can push the app to the device from the command line:

        $ cordova run android

Alternately within Eclipse, right-click the project and choose __Run
As &rarr; Android Application__.
