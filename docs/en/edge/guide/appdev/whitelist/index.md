# Domain Whitelist Guide

## Overview

Domain whitelisting is a security model that controls access to
outside domains, such as `http://google.com`.  Apache Cordova's
default security policy allows access to any site. Before moving your
application to production, you should review its whitelist and declare
access to specific network domains and subdomains.

## Specification

Domain whitelisting lays the groundwork for the [W3C Widget Access][1] specification. In the Widget Access specification, the `<access>` element is used to declare access to specific network domains. In the future, Apache Cordova will abstract the platform whitelisting implementations to the W3C Widget Access specification. However, for now each platform must implement its own domain whitelisting.

## Syntax

Access to [google.com][2]:

    http://google.com

Access to the secure [google.com][3] (`https://`):

    https://google.com

Access to the subdomain [maps.google.com][4]:

    http://maps.google.com

Access to all the subdomains on [google.com][2] (e.g. [mail.google.com][5] and [docs.google.com][6]):

    http://*.google.com

Access to all domains (e.g. [google.com][2] and [developer.mozilla.org][7]):

    *

## Android

### Details

The whitelisting rules are found in `res/xml/config.xml` and declared
with the element `<access origin="..." />`.

Android fully supports whitelisting syntax.

### Syntax

Access to [google.com][2]:

    <access origin="http://google.com" />

## BlackBerry

### Details

The whitelisting rules are found in `www/config.xml` and declared with the element `<access uri="..." />`.

For a complete reference, see the [BlackBerry WebWorks Access Element documentation][8].

### Syntax

Access to [google.com][2]:

    <access uri="http://google.com" subdomains="false" />

Access to  [maps.google.com][4]:

    <access uri="http://maps.google.com" subdomains="false" />

Access to all the subdomains on [google.com][2]:

    <access uri="http://google.com" subdomains="true" />

Access to all domains, including `file://` protocol:

    <access uri="*" subdomains="true" />

iOS
---

### Details

The whitelisting rules are found in `AppName/config.xml` and declared with the element `<access origin="..." />`.

iOS fully supports whitelisting syntax.

__NOTE:__ origins specified without a protocol, such as
`www.apache.org` rather than `http://www.apache.org`, default to all
of the `http`, `https`, `ftp`, and `ftps` schemes.

### Syntax

Wildcards on iOS (`*`) are more flexible than the [W3C Widget Access][1] specification.

Access to all subdomains and TLDs (`.com`, `.net`, etc):

    *.google.*

## Windows Phone (7 & 8)

The whitelisting rules are found in `config.xml` and declared with the element `<access origin="..." />`.

Android fully supports whitelisting syntax.

### Syntax

Access to [google.com][2]:

    <access origin="http://google.com" />

## Tizen

### Details

The application root directory's `config.xml` file specifies domain
whitelisting rules, using the `<access origin="..." />` element.
For a complete reference, see the [Tizen Accessing External Network Resources documentation][10].

### Syntax

Access to [google.com][2]:

    <access origin="http://google.com" subdomains="false" />

Access to the secure [google.com][3] (`https://`):

    <access origin="https://google.com" subdomains="false" />

Access to all the subdomains on [google.com][2]:

    <access origin="http://google.com" subdomains="true" />

Access to all domains, including `file://` protocol:

    <access origin="*" subdomains="true" />
