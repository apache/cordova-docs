Getting Started Guides
======================

To develop Cordova applications, you must install SDKs for each mobile
platform you are targeting. This installation is necessary even if you
intend to rely on cordova's command-line interface (CLI) for your build
cycle rather than individual SDK applications.
<!-- XREF
(See The Cordova Command-line Interface for details.)

This section tells you all you need to know to set up your development
environment to support each platform: where to obtain the SDK, how to
set up device emulators, and how to connect devices for direct
testing.  There is also information on lower-level command-line
utilities that are appropriate for development that is focused on
specific platforms' SDKs rather than the cordova CLI.
