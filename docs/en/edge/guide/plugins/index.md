# Plugin Development Guide

A Cordova plugin bridges a bit of functionality between the WebView
powering a Cordova application and the native platform the Cordova
application is running on. Plugins are composed of a single JavaScript
interface used across all platforms, and native implementations
following platform-specific Plugin interfaces that the JavaScript
calls into. All of the core Cordova APIs are implemented using this
architecture.

This guide steps the process of writing a simple Echo Plugin that
passes a string from JavaScript and sends it into the native
environment for the supported platforms. The native code then returns
the same string back to the callbacks inside the plugin's JavaScript.

This guide provides enough overview on which you can build to write
more complex plugins.

## JavaScript

The entry point for any plugin is JavaScript. The reason developers use
Cordova is so they can use and write JavaScript, not Objective-C,
not Java, not C#. The JavaScript interface for your plugin is the
front-facing and arguably most important part of your Cordova plugin.

You can structure your plugin's JavaScript however you like. The one
thing you _must_ use to communicate between the Cordova JavaScript
 and native environments is the `cordova.exec` function. Here is an example:

    cordova.exec(function(winParam) {}, function(error) {}, "service",
                 "action", ["firstArgument", "secondArgument", 42,
                 false]);

The parameters are detailed below:

1. `function(winParam) {}` - Success function callback. Assuming your
   `exec` call completes successfully, this function is invoked
    (optionally with any parameters you pass back to it).
2. `function(error) {}` - Error function callback. If the operation does
   not complete successfully, this function is invoked (optionally
   with an error parameter).
3. `"service"` - The service name to call into on the native side. This
   is mapped to a native class, about which more information is
   available in the native guides listed below.
4. `"action"` - The action name to call into. This is picked up by the
   native class receiving the `exec` call, and, depending on the
   platform, essentially maps to a class's method.
   The native guides listed below provide details.
5. `[/* arguments */]` - Arguments to pass into the native environment.

### Echo Plugin JavaScript Example

    window.echo = function(str, callback) {
        cordova.exec(callback, function(err) {
            callback('Nothing to echo.');
        }, "Echo", "echo", [str]);
    };

Let's dive into this. The plugin attaches itself to `window`,
specifically to the `echo` function. Plugin users would then use it as
follows:

    window.echo("echome", function(echoValue) {
        alert(echoValue == "echome"); // should alert true.
    });

First, let's take a look at the last three arguments to the `exec`
function. We will be calling the `Echo` "service", requesting the `echo`
"action", and passing an array of arguments containing the echo string,
which is the first parameter into the `window.echo` function.

The success callback passed into `exec` is simply a reference to the
callback function that `window.echo` takes. We do a bit more for the
error callback: if the native side fires off the error callback, we
simply invoke the success callback and pass into it a "default"
string.

## Native

Once you define JavaScript for your plugin, you need to complement it
with at least one native implementation. Details to do so for each
platform are listed below.  These guides continue to build on the
simple Echo Plugin example discussed above.

- Android Plugins
- BlackBerry Plugins
- BlackBerry 10 Plugins
- iOS Plugins
- Windows Phone Plugins

The Tizen platform currently does not support plugins.
