Overview
========

Cordova is an open-source mobile development framework. It allows you
to use standard web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
for cross-platform development, avoiding each mobile platforms' native
development language.  Applications execute as a WebView within a
native wrapper, and rely on standards-compliant Cordova API bindings
to access each device's sensors, data, and network status.

PhoneGap is a product offering based on the Cordova framework.  Its
PhoneGap Build service provides an additional way to build
applications remotely without having to run local tools.

Use Cordova if you are:

* a mobile developer and want to extend an application across more
  than one platform, without having to re-implement it with each
  platform's language and tool set.

* a web developer and want to deploy a web app that's packaged for
  distribution in various app store portals.

* a mobile developer interested in deploying a WebView that can access
  device-level APIs.

There are several different ways to use Cordova, depending on the kind
of tools and workflow you prefer. They all allow you to create new
projects, then rebuild them and preview them with an emulator:

* a single command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to specify all
  the mobile platforms you want to cover.

* a PhoneGap Build service that allows you to build cross-platform
  projects remotely.

* a set of command-line tools targeted for each mobile platform.

* as plug-ins to traditional IDE development environments.

The cross-platform command-line tools and PhoneGap build service offer
the quickest way overall to deploy a project, but IDEs offer the most
control to target applications for each platform.
