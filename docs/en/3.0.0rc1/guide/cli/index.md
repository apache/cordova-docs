# The Command-line Interface

This guide shows you how to create applications and deploy them to
various native mobile platforms using the `cordova` command-line
interface (CLI). This tool allows you to create new projects, build
them on different platforms, and run them within an emulator. You can
also use the CLI to initialize project code, after which you use
various platforms' SDKs to develop them further.

## Prerequisites

Before running any command-line tools, you need to install SDKs for
each platform you wish to target.
(See the Platform Guides for more details.)

To add support or rebuild a project for any platform, you need to run
the command-line interface from the same machine that supports the
platform's SDK. The CLI supports the following combinations:

* iOS             (Mac)
* Android         (Mac, Linux)
* BlackBerry      (Mac, Windows)
* Windows Phone 7 (Windows)
* Windows Phone 8 (Windows)

On the Mac, the command-line is available via the _Terminal_
application. On the PC, it's available as _Command Prompt_ under
_Accessories_.

The more likely it is that you run the CLI from different machines,
the more it makes sense to maintain a remote source code repository,
whose assets you pull down to local working directories.

To install the `cordova` command-line tool, follow these steps:

1. Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Following
   installation, you should be able to invoke `node` or `npm` on your
   command line.

1. Install the `cordova` utility. In Unix, prefixing the additional
   `sudo` command may be necessary to install development utilities in
   otherwise restricted directories:

        $ sudo npm install -g cordova

   The installation log may produce errors for any uninstalled
   platform SDKs.  Following installation, you should be able to run
   `cordova` on the command line.

## Create the App

Go to the directory where you maintain your source code, and run a
command such as the following:

        $ cordova create HelloWorld com.example.hello "Hello World"

The first argument specifies a _HelloWorld_ directory to be generated
for your project. Its `www` subdirectory houses your application's
home page, along with various resources under `css`, `js`, and `img`,
which follow common web development file-naming conventions. The
`config.xml` file contains important metadata needed to generate and
distribute the application.

The other two arguments are optional: the `com.example.hello` argument
provides your project with a reverse domain-style identifier, and the
`"Hello World!"` provides the application's display text. You can edit
both of these values later in the `config.xml` file.

## Add Platforms

All subsequent commands need to be run within the project's directory,
or any subdirectories within its scope:

        $ cd HelloWorld

Before you can build the project, you need to specify a set of target
platforms. Your ability to run these commands depends on whether your
machine supports each SDK, and whether you have already installed each
SDK.  Run any of these from a Mac:

        $ cordova platform add ios
        $ cordova platform add android
        $ cordova platform add blackberry

Run any of these from a Windows machine, where _wp_ refers to
different versions of the Windows Phone operating system:

        $ cordova platform add wp7
        $ cordova platform add wp8
        $ cordova platform add android
        $ cordova platform add blackberry

Run this to check your current set of platforms:

        $ cordova platforms ls

(Note the `platform` and `platforms` commands are synonymous.)

Run either of the following synonymous commands to remove a platform:

        $ cordova platform remove blackberry
        $ cordova platform rm android

Running commands to add or remove platforms affects the contents of
the project's _platforms_ directory, where each specified platform
appears as a subdirectory. The _www_ source directory is reproduced
within each platform's subdirectory, appearing for example in
`platforms/ios/www` or `platforms/android/assets/www`.  By default,
each platform's configuration file is set up to be able to access all
of Cordova's APIs.

If you wish, you can use an SDK at this point to open the project you
created. However, any edits you make to the project within an SDK
affect the derivative set of assets, not the original cross-platform
source files. Use this approach if you simply want to initialize a
project.
(See the Platform Guides for information on how to develop applications within each SDK.)
Read on if you wish to use command-line tools for the entire
development cycle.

## Build the App

By default, the `cordova create` script generates a skeletal web-based
application whose home page is the project's `www/index.html` file.
Edit this application however you want, but any initialization should
be specified as part of the `deviceready` event handler, referenced by
default from `www/js/index.js`.
<!-- XREF

Run the following command to iteratively build the project:

        $ cordova build

This generates platform-specific code within the project's `platforms`
subdirectory.  You can optionally limit the scope of each build to
specific platforms:

        $ cordova build ios

The `cordova build` command is a shorthand for the following, which in
this example is also targeted to a single platform:

        $ cordova prepare ios
        $ cordova compile ios

In this case, once you run `prepare`, you can use Apple's Xcode SDK as
an alternative to modify and compile the platform-specific code that
Cordova generates within `platforms/ios`. You can use the same
approach with other platforms' SDKs.

## View the App in an Emulator

SDKs for mobile platforms often come bundled with emulators that
execute a device image, so that you can launch the app from the home
screen and see how it interacts with many platform features.  Run a
command such as the following to rebuild the app and view it within a
specific platform's emulator:

        $ cordova emulate android

Some mobile platforms emulate a particular device by default, such as
the iPhone for iOS projects. For other platforms, you may need to
first associate a device with an emulator.
(See the Platform Guides for details.)
For example, you may first run the `android` command to launch the
Android SDK, then run a particular device image, which launches it
according to its default behavior:

![](img/guide/cli/android_emulate_init.png)

Following up with the `cordova emulate` command refreshes the emulator
image to display the latest application, which is now available for
launch from the home screen:

![](img/guide/cli/android_emulate_install.png)

## Add Features

When you build and view a new project, the default application that
appears doesn't do very much. You can modify the app in many ways to
take advantage of standard web technologies, but for the app to
communicate closely with various device-level features, you need to
add plugins that provide access to core Cordova APIs.

A _plugin_ is a bit of add-on code that provides an interface to
native components. You can design your own plugin interface, for
example when designing a hybrid app that mixes a Cordova WebView with
native components. (See Embedding WebViews and Plugin Development Guide for details.)  More commonly, you would add a plugin to enable
one of Cordova's basic device-level features
<!-- XREF
discussed in the Application Development Guide and
XREF -->
detailed in the API Reference.

The `cordova plugin add` command requires you to specify the
repository for the plugin code.  Here are examples of features you
might add:

* Basic device information:
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-device.git
* Network and battery status:
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-network-information.git
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-battery-status.git
* Accelerometer, compass, and geolocation:
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-device-motion.git
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-device-orientation.git
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-geolocation.git
* Camera, media capture, and media playback:
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-camera.git
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-media-capture.git
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-media.git    
* Access files on device or network:
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-file.git
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-file-transfer.git
* Notifications via dialog box or vibration:
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-dialogs.git
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-vibration.git
* Contacts:
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-contacts.git
* Globalization:
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-globalization.git
* Splash Screen:
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-splashscreen.git
* In-app browser:
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser.git
* Debug console:
    $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-console.git

Use `plugin ls` (or `plugin list`) to view currently installed
plugins. Each displays by its identifier:

    $ cordova plugin ls    # or 'plugin list'
    [ 'org.apache.cordova.core.console' ]

To remove a plugin, refer to it by the same identifier that appears in
the listing. For example, here is how you would remove support for a
debug console from a release version:

    $ cordova plugin rm org.apache.cordova.core.console        
    $ cordova plugin remove org.apache.cordova.core.console    # same

You can batch-remove or add plugins by specifying more than one
argument for each command.

## Update the App

After installing installing the `cordova` utility, you can always
update it to the latest version by running the following command:

        $ sudo npm update -g cordova

Use this syntax to install a specific version:

        $ sudo npm install -g cordova@2.8.0

Run the `info` command for a listing that includes the current version
along with other available version numbers:

        $ npm info cordova
