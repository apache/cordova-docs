# Upgrading iOS

This guide shows how to modify iOS projects to upgrade from older versions of Cordova.
Most of these instructions apply to projects created with an older set
of command-line tools that precede the `cordova` CLI utility. See The
Cordova Command-line Interface for information how to update the
version of the CLI.

Please note that **Xcode 4.5 is required**. To submit to the Apple App Store, you must use the latest shipped version of the iOS SDK, which is iOS 6. The iOS 6 SDK requires Xcode 4.5.

## Upgrade to the CLI (3.0.0) from 2.9.0 ##

1. Create a new Apache Cordova 3.0.0 project using the cordova CLI, as
   described in The Cordova Command-line Interface.
2. Add your platforms the the cordova project, for example: `cordova
   platform add ios`.
3. Copy the contents of the project's `www` folder to the `www` folder
   at the root of the cordova project you just created.
4. Copy or overwrite any native assets from your original project
   (`Resources`, etc.), making sure to add any
   new files to the `.xcodeproj` project. The iOS project builds
   inside the `platforms\ios` directory.
5. Copy your config.xml into the www folder, and remove any plugin definitions. You will modify settings here instead of the platform folder.
6. Use the cordova CLI tool to install any plugins you need. Note that
   the CLI handles all core APIs as plugins, so they may need to be
   added. Only 3.0.0 plugins are compatible with the CLI.
7. Build and test.


## Upgrading 2.9.0 projects to 3.0.0 ##

1. **Download and extract the Cordova 3.0.0 source** to a **permanent folder location** on your hard drive (say to ~/Documents/Cordova-3.0.0)
2. **Quit Xcode** if it is running.
3. **Navigate** to the directory where you put the downloaded source above, using **Terminal.app**.
4. **Create a new project**, as described in iOS Command-line Tools. You need the assets from this new project.
5. **Copy** the **www/cordova.js** (note that it does not have a version suffix anymore, the version is in the file itself in the header) file from the new project into your **www** folder, and delete your **www/cordova.js** file
6. **Update** the Cordova script reference in your **www/index.html** file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new **cordova.js** file
7. Delete your **"CordovaLib"** folder, and copy the **"CordovaLib"** folder from the new project into your project's root folder

NOTE: Starting with Cordova 3.0.0, projects do not come with any plugins, you will have to install the ones you require for your project using the `plugman` CLI utility - see the "Using Plugman to Manage Plugins".

## Upgrading 2.8.0 projects to 2.9.0 ##

1. **Download and extract the Cordova 2.9.0 source** to a **permanent folder location** on your hard drive (say to ~/Documents/Cordova-2.9.0)
2. **Quit Xcode** if it is running.
3. **Navigate** to the directory where you put the downloaded source above, using **Terminal.app**.
4. **Create a new project**, as described in iOS Command-line Tools. You need the assets from this new project.
5. **Copy** the **www/cordova.js** (note that it does not have a version suffix anymore, the version is in the file itself in the header) file from the new project into your **www** folder, and delete your **www/cordova.js** file
6. **Update** the Cordova script reference in your **www/index.html** file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new **cordova.js** file
7. Delete your **"CordovaLib"** folder, and copy the **"CordovaLib"** folder from the new project into your project's root folder

## Upgrading 2.7.0 projects to 2.8.0 ##

1. **Download and extract the Cordova 2.8.0 source** to a **permanent folder location** on your hard drive (say to ~/Documents/Cordova-2.8.0)
2. **Quit Xcode** if it is running.
3. **Navigate** to the directory where you put the downloaded source above, using **Terminal.app**.
4. **Create a new project**, as described in iOS Command-line Tools. You need the assets from this new project.
5. **Copy** the **www/cordova.js** (note that it does not have a version suffix anymore, the version is in the file itself in the header) file from the new project into your **www** folder, and delete your **www/cordova-2.7.0.js** file
6. **Update** the Cordova script reference in your **www/index.html** file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new **cordova.js** file
7. Update any &lt;plugin&gt; tags that are in your **config.xml** to &lt;feature&gt; tags. Note that existing &lt;plugin&gt; tags will still work, but are deprecated. You can copy this information in the **config.xml** for a new project. For example:

        <plugins>
            <plugin name="LocalStorage" value="CDVLocalStorage" />
            <!-- other plugins -->
        </plugins>
        
        <!-- change to: (note that a <feature> tag is on the same level as <plugins> -->
        <feature name="LocalStorage">
    	    <param name="ios-package" value="CDVLocalStorage" />
    	</feature>
    	<!-- other <feature> tags -->
        
8. Delete your **"CordovaLib"** folder, and copy the **"CordovaLib"** folder from the new project into your project's root folder
9. Add these two frameworks to your project:
        
        OpenAL
        ImageIO
        
10. Update your project's target **Build Settings**. Under **Linking** -> **Other Linker Flags**, edit **"-Obj-C"** to be **"-ObjC"**
        
11. Update your project's target **Build Settings**. Under **Linking** -> **Other Linker Flags**, change **"-all\_load"** to be **"-force\_load ${BUILT\_PRODUCTS\_DIR}/libCordova.a"**. You would only need to do this if you have the problem defined in [this issue.](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-3458)

## Upgrading 2.2.0 projects to 2.3.0 ##

1. **Download and extract the Cordova 2.3.0 source** to a **permanent folder location** on your hard drive (say to ~/Documents/Cordova-2.3.0)
2. **Quit Xcode** if it is running.
3. **Navigate** to the directory where you put the downloaded source above, using **Terminal.app**.
4. **Create a new project**, as described in iOS Command-line Tools. You need the assets from this new project.
5. **Copy** the **www/cordova-2.3.0.js** file from the new project into your **www** folder, and delete your **www/cordova-2.2.0.js** file
6. **Update** the Cordova script reference in your `www/index.html` file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new **cordova-2.3.0.js** file

8. Delete your **cordova** folder, and copy the **cordova** folder from the new project into your project's root folder **(in 2.3.0, this has new scripts)**
9. Delete your **CordovaLib** folder, and copy the **CordovaLib** folder from the new project into your project's root folder
10. Convert your `Cordova.plist` file to `config.xml`, by running the script **bin/cordova\_plist\_to\_config\_xml** on your project file.
11. Add the InAppBrowser plugin to your `config.xml`, by adding this tag under **&lt;cordova&gt;&lt;plugins&gt;**:

        <plugin name="InAppBrowser" value="CDVInAppBrowser" />
12. Note that Objective-C plugins are **not** whitelisted anymore. To whitelist your connections with the app whitelist, you will need to set the “User-Agent” header of the connection to the same user-agent as the main Cordova WebView.
You can get this by accessing the **userAgent** property off the main view-controller. The main view-controller (CDVViewController) also has a **URLisAllowed** method for you to check whether a URL will pass the whitelist.
13. Device API changes:
    * For iOS, device.platform used to return “iPhone”, “iPad” or “iPod Touch” — now it returns (correctly) “iOS”.
    * For iOS, device.name (now deprecated for all platforms) used to return the name of the user’s device (e.g ‘Shazron’s iPhone 5′) — now it returns what device.platform used to return: ”iPhone”, “iPad” or “iPod Touch”.
    * For all platforms, there is a new property called device.model — this returns the specific device model, e.g “iPad2,5″ (for other platforms, this returns what device.name used to return).

## Upgrading 2.1.0 projects to 2.2.0 ##

1. **Download and extract the Cordova 2.2.0 source** to a **permanent folder location** on your hard drive (say to ~/Documents/Cordova-2.2.0)
2. **Quit Xcode** if it is running.
3. **Navigate** to the directory where you put the downloaded source above, using **Terminal.app**.
4. **Create a new project**, as described in iOS Command-line Tools. You need the assets from this new project.
5. **Copy** the **www/cordova-2.2.0.js** file from the new project into your **www** folder, and delete your **www/cordova-2.1.0.js** file
6. **Update** the Cordova script reference in your `www/index.html` file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new **cordova-2.2.0.js** file

    - Updated &rarr; viewWillAppear
8. Copy the **cordova** folder from the new project into your project's root folder **(in 2.2.0, this has an updated 'emulate' script)**
9. Next, update your CordovaLib sub-project reference. Beginning with Cordova 2.1.0, we are not using the CORDOVALIB Xcode variable anymore when referencing where CordovaLib resides, the reference is an absolute file reference now.
    1. Launch **Terminal.app**
    2. Go to the location where you installed Cordova (see Step 1), in the **bin** sub-folder
    3. Run the script below where the first parameter is the path to your project's **.xcodeproj** file:

        `update_cordova_subproject path/to/your/project/xcodeproj`

__NOTE:__ In 2.2.0, the `bin/create` script copy in the CordovaLib sub-project into your project. To have the same kind of setup, just copy in the right CordovaLib into your project folder, and update the CordovaLib sub-project location (relative to the project) in the Xcode File Inspector.

## Upgrading 2.0.0 projects to 2.1.0 ##

With **Cordova 2.1.0**, CordovaLib has been upgraded to use **Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)**. You don't need to upgrade to **ARC** to use CordovaLib, but if you want to upgrade your project to use **ARC**, please use the Xcode migration wizard from the menu: **Edit &rarr; Refactor &rarr; Convert to Objective-C ARC...**, **de-select libCordova.a**, then run the wizard to completion.

1. **Download and extract the Cordova 2.1.0 source** to a **permanent folder location** on your hard drive (say to ~/Documents/Cordova-2.1.0)
2. **Quit Xcode** if it is running.
3. **Navigate** to the directory where you put the downloaded source above, using **Terminal.app**.

7. **Update** the Cordova script reference in your `www/index.html` file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new **cordova-2.1.0.js** file
8. Update (or replace, if you never changed the file) your `AppDelegate.m` according to the one from the new project:
    - Edited -> application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:
	- Added  -> application:supportedInterfaceOrientationsForWindow:
9. Update (or replace, if you never changed the file) your `MainViewController.m` according to the one from the new project:
    - Added -> viewWillAppear
10. Copy the **cordova** folder from the new project into your project's root folder **(in 2.1.0, this has the updated scripts to support paths with spaces)**
11. Remove the **VERSION** file reference from your **project** (_not_ the one in CordovaLib)
12. Next, update your CordovaLib sub-project reference. Beginning with Cordova 2.1.0, we are not using the CORDOVALIB Xcode variable anymore when referencing where CordovaLib resides, the reference is an absolute file reference now.
    1. Launch **Terminal.app**
    2. Go to the location where you installed Cordova **(see Step 1)**, in the **bin** sub-folder
    3. Run the script below where the first parameter is the path to your project's **.xcodeproj** file:

        `update_cordova_subproject path/to/your/project/xcodeproj`

## Upgrading 1.9.0 projects to 2.0.0 ##

1. **Install** Cordova 2.0.0
2. **Create a new project**, as described in iOS Command-line Tools. You need the assets from this new project.

11. Locate the **CordovaLib** folder that was installed in your hard-drive under your home folder's **Documents** sub-folder.
12. Locate the `CordovaLib.xcodeproj` file in the **CordovaLib** folder, then **drag and drop** the file into your project - it should appear as a **sub-project**.
13. **Build** your project, you should get some **errors** relating to **#import** directives
14. For the **#import errors**, change any **quote-based** imports in this style:

        #import "CDV.h"

    to this **brackets-based** style:

        #import <Cordova/CDV.h>

    and remove any **#ifdef** wrappers around any Cordova imports, they are not needed anymore (the imports are **unified** now)
15. **Build** your project again, and it should not have any **#import** errors.

26. Select the **Create groups for any added folders** radiobutton, then select the **Finish** button
27. Select the **VERSION** file that you just dragged in a previous step
28. Type the **Option-Command-1** key combination to show the **File Inspector** (or menuitem **View -> Utilities -> Show File Inspector**)
29. Choose **Relative to CORDOVALIB** in the **File Inspector** for the drop-down menu for **Location**
30. Set the Xcode preference **Xcode Preferences -> Locations -> Derived Data -> Advanced...** to **Unique** (this is so the unified headers can be found)
31. Select the **project icon** in the Project Navigator, select your **Target**, then select the **Build Settings** tab
32. Search for **Header Search Paths**. For that setting, add these three values below (with quotes):

        "$(TARGET_BUILD_DIR)/usr/local/lib/include"

        "$(OBJROOT)/UninstalledProducts/include"

        "$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)"
