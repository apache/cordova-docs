device.uuid
===========

Get the device's Universally Unique Identifier ([UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier)).

    var string = device.uuid;

Description
-----------

The details of how a UUID is generated are determined by the device manufacturer and are specific to the device's platform or model.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- Android
- BlackBerry WebWorks (OS 5.0 and higher)
- iOS
- Tizen
- Windows Phone 7 and 8
- Windows 8

Quick Example
-------------

    // Android: Returns a random 64-bit integer (as a string, again!)
    //          The integer is generated on the device's first boot
    //
    // BlackBerry: Returns the PIN number of the device
    //             This is a nine-digit unique integer (as a string, though!)
    //
    // iPhone: (Paraphrased from the UIDevice Class documentation)
    //         Returns a string of hash values created from multiple hardware identifies.
    //         It is guaranteed to be unique for every device and cannot be tied
    //         to the user account.
    // Windows Phone 7 : Returns a hash of device+current user,
    // if the user is not defined, a guid is generated and will persist until the app is uninstalled
    // Tizen: returns the device IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity or IMEI is a number
    // unique to every GSM and UMTS mobile phone.
    var deviceID = device.uuid;

Full Example
------------

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Device Properties Example</title>

        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="cordova-3.0.0.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">

        // Wait for device API libraries to load
        //
        document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

        // device APIs are available
        //
        function onDeviceReady() {
            var element = document.getElementById('deviceProperties');
            element.innerHTML = 'Device Name: '     + device.name     + '<br />' +
                                'Device Cordova: '  + device.cordova  + '<br />' +
                                'Device Platform: ' + device.platform + '<br />' +
                                'Device UUID: '     + device.uuid     + '<br />' +
                                'Device Version: '  + device.version  + '<br />';
        }

        </script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p id="deviceProperties">Loading device properties...</p>
      </body>
    </html>

iOS Quirk
-------------

The `uuid` on iOS is not unique to a device, but varies for each
application, for each installation.  It changes if you delete and
re-install the app, and possibly also when you upgrade iOS, or even
upgrade your app per version (apparent in iOS 5.1). The `uuid` is not
a reliable value.

Windows Phone 7 and 8 Quirks
-------------

The `uuid` for Windows Phone 7 requires the permission
`ID_CAP_IDENTITY_DEVICE`.  Microsoft will likely deprecate this
property soon.  If the capability is not available, the application
generates a persistent guid that is maintained for the duration of the
application's installation on the device.
