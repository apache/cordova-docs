CaptureVideoOptions
===================

> Encapsulates video capture configuration options.

Properties
----------

- __limit__: The maximum number of video clips the device's user can capture in a single capture operation.  The value must be greater than or equal to 1 (defaults to 1).
- __duration__: The maximum duration of a video clip, in seconds.

Quick Example
-------------

    // limit capture operation to 3 video clips
    var options = { limit: 3 };

    navigator.device.capture.captureVideo(captureSuccess, captureError, options);

BlackBerry WebWorks Quirks
--------------------------

- The __duration__ parameter is not supported, so the length of recordings cannot be limited programmatically.

iOS Quirks
----------

- The __limit__ parameter is not supported.  Only one video is recorded per invocation.
