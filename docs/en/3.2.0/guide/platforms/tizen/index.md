# Tizen Platform Guide

This guide describes how to set up your SDK development environment to
deploy Cordova apps for devices running the Tizen operating system.

## Requirements and Support

The Tizen SDK requires Linux Ubuntu 10.04/10.10/11.04/11.10 (32-bit),
or Windows XP SP3/7 (32-bit).

Developers should use the `cordova` utility in conjunction with
the Tizen SDK.  See The Command-Line Interface for information
how to install it, add projects, then build and deploy a project.

## Install the SDK

Download the Tizen SDK from
[tizen.org](https://developer.tizen.org/sdk).

<!--

- (optional) Install Tizen Cordova template projects: copy the
  `/templates` directory content into the Tizen Eclipse IDE web
  templates directory (e.g:
  `/home/my_username/tizen-sdk/IDE/Templates/web`).

- __Method #2: Use Tizen Eclipse IDE Cordova Tizen project templates__
    - Launch Tizen Eclipse IDE
    - Select  __File &rarr; New &rarr; Tizen Web Project__
    - Select __User Template__ and __User defined__ items
    - Select one of the Tizen Cordova template (e.g: __CordovaBasicTemplate__)
    - Fill the __Project name__ and its target __Location__

    - Click __Finish__

    - Your project should now appear in the __Project Explorer__ view

-->

## Open a Project in the SDK

1. Launch the Tizen Eclipse IDE.

2. Select __File &rarr; Import &rarr; Tizen Web Project__:

To rebuild the project, right-click in the __Project Explorer__ view
and Select __Build Project__:

A widget package file such as _hello.wgt_ should generate in the
project's root directory.

## Deploy to Emulator

Right-click the project in the __Project Explorer__ view and select
__Run As &rarr; Tizen Web Simulator Application__:

## Deploy to Device

* Make sure that the target device is properly launched, connected and
  configured. Its __Date and Time__ settings must be set correctly.

* Use the __Connection Explorer__ view to select the application
  deployment target: __Window &rarr; Show View &rarr; Connection
  Explorer__.
