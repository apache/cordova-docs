# MediaFile.getFormatData

> Retrieves format information about the media capture file.

    mediaFile.getFormatData(
        MediaFileDataSuccessCB successCallback,
        [MediaFileDataErrorCB errorCallback]
    );

## Description

This function asynchronously attempts to retrieve the format
information for the media file.  If successful, it invokes the
`MediaFileDataSuccessCB` callback with a `MediaFileData` object.  If
the attempt fails, this function invokes the `MediaFileDataErrorCB`
callback.
