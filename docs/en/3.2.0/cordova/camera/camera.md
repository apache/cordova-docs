# Camera

> The `camera` object provides access to the device's default camera application.

__WARNING__: Collection and use of images from a
device's camera raises important privacy issues.  Your app's privacy
policy should discuss how the app uses the camera and whether the
images recorded are shared with any other parties.  In addition, if
the app's use of the camera is not apparent in the user interface, you
should provide a just-in-time notice before the app accesses the
camera (if the device operating system doesn't do so already).  That
notice should provide the same information noted above, as well as
obtaining the user's permission (e.g., by presenting choices for
__OK__ and __No Thanks__).  For more information, please see the
Privacy Guide.

## Methods

- camera.getPicture
- camera.cleanup

## Accessing the Feature

As of version 3.0, Cordova implements device-level APIs as _plugins_.
Use the CLI's `plugin` command, described in The Command-Line
Interface, to add or remove this feature for a project:

        $ cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.camera
        $ cordova plugin ls
        [ 'org.apache.cordova.camera' ]
        $ cordova plugin rm org.apache.cordova.camera

These commands apply to all targeted platforms, but modify the
platform-specific configuration settings described below:
