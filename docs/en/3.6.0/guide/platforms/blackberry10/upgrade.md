# Upgrading BlackBerry 10

This guide shows how to modify BlackBerry projects to upgrade from older versions of Cordova.
Most of these instructions apply to projects created with an older set
of command-line tools that precede the `cordova` CLI utility. See The Command-Line Interface for information how to update the
version of the CLI.

## Upgrading to 3.2.0 from 3.1.0

For projects that were created with the cordova CLI: 

1. Update the `cordova` CLI version. See The Command-Line Interface.

2. Run `cordova platform update blackberry`
        
For projects not created with the cordova CLI, run:

        bin/update <project_path>

## Upgrade to 3.1.0 from 3.0.0

1. Create a new Apache Cordova 3.1.0 project using the cordova CLI, as
   described in The Command-Line Interface.

2. Add your platforms to the cordova project, for example: `cordova
   platform add blackberry10`.

3. Copy the contents of the original project's `www` directory to the `www` directory
   at the root of the cordova project you just created.

4. Copy or overwrite any native assets from your original project
   (`Resources`, etc.)

5. Copy the `config.xml` file into the `www` directory, and remove any
   plugin definitions. You need to modify settings here rather than
   within the platform directory.

6. Use the cordova CLI tool to install any plugins you need. Note that
   the CLI handles all core APIs as plugins, so they may need to be
   added. Only plugins marked 3.0.0 and above are compatible with the CLI.

7. Build and test.

Please note that the CLI supports the BlackBerry10 platform exclusively. For PlayBook and BBOS, please see Cordova version 2.9.0 and below.

## Upgrade to the CLI (3.0.0) from 2.9.0

1. Create a new Apache Cordova 3.0.0 project using the cordova CLI, as
   described in The Command-Line Interface.

2. Add your platforms to the cordova project, for example: `cordova
   platform add blackberry10`.

3. Copy the contents of the original project's `www` directory to the `www` directory
   at the root of the cordova project you just created.

4. Copy or overwrite any native assets from your original project
   (`Resources`, etc.)

5. Copy the `config.xml` file into the `www` directory, and remove any
   plugin definitions. You need to modify settings here rather than
   within the platform directory.

6. Use the cordova CLI tool to install any plugins you need. Note that
   the CLI handles all core APIs as plugins, so they may need to be
   added. Only 3.0.0 plugins are compatible with the CLI.

7. Build and test.

## Upgrading 2.8.0 Projects to 2.9.0

For BlackBerry 10:

1. Download and extract the Cordova 2.9.0 source to a permanent directory location on your hard drive, for example to `~/Cordova-2.9.0`.

2. Quit any running SDK tools: Eclipse, Momentics and the like.

3. Navigate to the directory where you put the downloaded source above, using a unix like terminal: Terminal.app, Bash, Cygwin, etc.

4. Create a new project, as described in BlackBerry Shell Tool Guide. This becomes the home of your updated project.

5. Copy your projects source from the old project's `/www` directory to the new project's `/www` directory.

6. Update the Cordova script reference in the `www/index.html` file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new `cordova.js` file.

For BlackBerryOS/Playbook:

1. Download and extract the Cordova 2.9.0 source to a permanent directory location on your hard drive, for example to `~/Cordova-2.9.0`.

2. Quit any running SDK tools: Eclipse, Momentics and the like.

3. Navigate to the directory where you put the downloaded source above, using a unix like terminal: Terminal.app, Bash, Cygwin, etc.

4. Create a new project, as described in iOS Shell Tool Guide. You need the assets from this new project.

5. Copy the `www/cordova.js` file from the new project into the `www` directory, and delete the `www/cordova.js` file.

6. Update the Cordova script reference in the `www/index.html` file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new `cordova.js` file.

7. Copy the `native` directory from the new project into the existing project, overwriting the old `native` directory.

8. Copy the `lib` directory from the new project into the existing project, overwriting the old `lib` directory.

9. Copy the `cordova` directory from the new project into the existing project, overwriting the old `cordova` directory.

## Upgrading 2.7.0 Projects to 2.8.0

BlackBerry 10 uses the new CLI tooling and manages core APIs as plugins. The instructions migrate your project to a new project, rather than updating an existing project, due to the complexity of updating an old project.
Also note that the cordova js script file is now called 'cordova.js' and no longer contains a version string.

1. Download and extract the Cordova 2.8.0 source to a permanent directory location on your hard drive, for example to `~/Cordova-2.8.0`.

2. Quit any running SDK tools: Eclipse, Momentics and the like.

3. Navigate to the directory where you put the downloaded source above, using a unix like terminal: Terminal.app, Bash, Cygwin, etc.

4. Create a new project, as described in BlackBerry Shell Tool Guide. This becomes the home of your updated project.

5. Copy your projects source from the old project's `/www` directory to the new project's `/www` directory.

6. Update the Cordova script reference in the `www/index.html` file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new `cordova.js` file.

For BlackBerryOS/Playbook:

1. Download and extract the Cordova 2.8.0 source to a permanent directory location on your hard drive, for example to `~/Cordova-2.8.0`.

2. Quit any running SDK tools: Eclipse, Momentics and the like.

3. Navigate to the directory where you put the downloaded source above, using a unix like terminal: Terminal.app, Bash, Cygwin, etc.

4. Create a new project, as described in iOS Shell Tool Guide. You need the assets from this new project.

5. Copy the `www/cordova.js` file from the new project into the `www` directory, and delete the `www/cordova.js` file.

6. Update the Cordova script reference in the `www/index.html` file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new `cordova.js` file.

7. Copy the `native` directory from the new project into the existing project, overwriting the old `native` directory.

8. Copy the `lib` directory from the new project into the existing project, overwriting the old `lib` directory.

9. Copy the `cordova` directory from the new project into the existing project, overwriting the old `cordova` directory.

## Upgrading 2.6.0 Projects to 2.7.0

1. Download and extract the Cordova 2.7.0 source to a permanent directory location on your hard drive, for example to `~/Cordova-2.7.0`.

2. Quit any running SDK tools: Eclipse, Momentics and the like.

3. Navigate to the directory where you put the downloaded source above, using a unix like terminal: Terminal.app, Bash, Cygwin, etc.

4. Create a new project, as described in BlackBerry Shell Tool Guide. You need the assets from this new project.

5. Copy the `www/cordova-2.7.0.js` file from the new project into the `www` directory, and delete the `www/cordova-2.6.0.js` file.

6. Update the Cordova script reference in the `www/index.html` file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new `cordova-2.7.0.js` file.

7. Copy the `native` directory from the new project into the existing project, overwriting the old `native` directory.

8. Copy the `lib` directory from the new project into the existing project, overwriting the old `lib` directory.

9. Copy the `cordova` directory from the new project into the existing project, overwriting the old `cordova` directory.
