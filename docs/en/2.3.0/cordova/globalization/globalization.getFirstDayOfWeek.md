globalization.getFirstDayOfWeek
===========

Returns the first day of the week according to the client's user preferences and calendar.

    navigator.globalization.getFirstDayOfWeek(successCB, errorCB);
    
Description
-----------

The days of the week are numbered starting from 1 where 1 is considered to be Sunday. It returns the day to the successCB callback with a properties object as a parameter. That object should have a ``value`` property with a Number value.

If there is an error obtaining the pattern, then the errorCB callback is invoked with a GlobalizationError object as a parameter. The expected code for this error is GlobalizationError.UNKNOWN\_ERROR.


Supported Platforms
-------------------

- Android
- BlackBerry WebWorks (OS 5.0 and higher)
- iPhone

Quick Example
-------------

In the case when the browser is set to the en\_US locale, this should display a popup dialog with text similar to "day: 1".

    navigator.globalization.getFirstDayOfWeek(
      function (day) {alert('day: ' + day.value + '\n');},
      function () {alert('Error getting day\n');}
    );
