Methods
-------

- __clone__: Returns a new Contact object that is a deep copy of the calling object, with the id property set to `null`. 
- __remove__: Removes the contact from the device contacts database.  An error callback is called with a `ContactError` object if the removal is unsuccessful.
- __save__: Saves a new contact to the device contacts database, or updates an existing contact if a contact with the same __id__ already exists.


Details
-------

The `Contact` object represents a user contact.  Contacts can be created, saved to, or removed from the device contacts database.  Contacts can also be retrieved (individually or in bulk) from the database by invoking the `contacts.find` method.

_Note: Not all of the above contact fields are supported on every device platform.  Please check each platform's Quirks section for information about which fields are supported._
