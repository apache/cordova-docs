# Windows Phone 8.0 WebViews

This guide shows how to embed a Cordova-enabled WebView component
within a larger Windows Phone 8.0 application. 

To follow these instructions, make sure you have the latest Cordova 
distribution. Download it from 
[cordova.apache.org](http://cordova.apache.org) and unzip its 
Windows Phone 8.0 package (cordova-wp8-*.zip).

1. Navigate to the package's `wp8/framework` directory and build
   `WPCordovaClassLib.sln`. 
   It creates the `Bin\Debug[Release]\WPCordovaClassLib.dll`.

1. Copy the `WPCordovaClassLib.dll` file into the Windows Phone 8 project's
    `/libs` directory and include `WPCordovaClassLib.dll` to your
    project via `Project->References->Add Reference`.
    Alternatively, you can directly reference the
    `wp8/framework/WPCordovaClassLib.csproj` file.

1. Add `CordovaView` component to your page (for example, `MainPage.xaml`).

        xmlns:my="clr-namespace:WPCordovaClassLib;assembly=WPCordovaClassLib">
        ...
        <my:CordovaView HorizontalAlignment="Stretch" Margin="0,0,0,0" 
        StartPageUri="html/index.html" x:Name="CordovaView" VerticalAlignment="Stretch" />

1. Copy `common/www/cordova.js` along with the application's HTML 
    and JavaScript files to the Windows Phone 8 project's `html` directory
    and include new files to the project.

1. Copy the `wp8/template/config.xml`to the project's root directory and
