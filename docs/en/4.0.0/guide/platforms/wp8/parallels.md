# Configuring Parallels Desktop

This section shows how to configure Parallels Desktop on a Mac so that
you can use Cordova to generate Windows Phone applications.

The
[Microsoft Developer Network](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/windows/apps/jj945424)
provides general instructions for how to run Windows under Parallels
Desktop. After installing Windows, follow these steps:

1. Within Parallels Desktop, select the Windows 8 disk image you have
   prepared, and choose __Settings__.

1. Choose the __General &rarr; CPUs__ options. Specify _two_ CPUs.
   Specify at least 2GB of memory, even if it falls outside the
   recommended range:

1. To be able to run the device emulator image within the Windows 8
   virtual machine, choose the __Optimizations__ options and enable
   __Nested Virtualization__.

Once you complete these steps, you are ready to install the Windows
Phone SDK.  See the Windows Phone 8 Platform Guide for details.
