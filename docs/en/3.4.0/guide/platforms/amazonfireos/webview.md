# Amazon Fire OS WebViews

Beginning with 3.0.0, you can use Cordova as a component in Amazon Fire OS applications. Amazon Fire OS refers to this component as `CordovaWebView`. `CordovaWebView` extends Amazon WebView that is built on the open source Chromium Project. By leveraging this feature, your web apps can utilize the latest HTML5 web standards running in a modern web runtime engine.

## Prerequisites

* Cordova 3.0.0 or greater

* Android SDK updated to the latest SDK

* Amazon WebView SDK

## Guide to using CordovaWebView in a Amazon Fire OS Project

1. Download and expand the [Amazon WebView SDK](https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/fire/IntegratingAWV.html#installawv) , then copy the awv_interface.jar into `/framework/libs` directory. Create a libs/ folder if it doesn't exist.

2. `cd` into `/framework` and run `ant jar` to build the cordova jar. It creates the .jar file formed as `cordova-3.4.0.jar` in the `/framework` directory.

3. Edit your application's `main.xml` file (under `/res/layout`) to look like the following, with the `layout_height`, `layout_width` and `id` modified to suit your application:

        <org.apache.cordova.CordovaWebView
            android:id="@+id/tutorialView"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent" />

4. Modify your activity so that it implements the `CordovaInterface`.  You should implement the included methods.  You may wish to copy them from `/framework/src/org/apache/cordova/CordovaActivity.java`, or implement them on your own.  The code fragment below shows a basic application that uses the interface. Note how the referenced view id matches the `id` attribute specified in the XML fragment shown above:

        public class CordovaViewTestActivity extends Activity implements CordovaInterface {
            CordovaWebView cwv;
            /* Called when the activity is first created. */
            @Override
            public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
                super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
                setContentView(R.layout.main);
                cwv = (CordovaWebView) findViewById(R.id.tutorialView);
                Config.init(this);
                cwv.loadUrl(Config.getStartUrl());
            }

If you use the camera, you should also implement this:

        @Override
        public void setActivityResultCallback(CordovaPlugin plugin) {
            this.activityResultCallback = plugin;
        }
        /**
         * Launch an activity for which you would like a result when it finished. When this activity exits,
         * your onActivityResult() method is called.
         *
         * @param command           The command object
         * @param intent            The intent to start
         * @param requestCode       The request code that is passed to callback to identify the activity
         */
        public void startActivityForResult(CordovaPlugin command, Intent intent, int requestCode) {
            this.activityResultCallback = command;
            this.activityResultKeepRunning = this.keepRunning;

            // If multitasking turned on, then disable it for activities that return results
            if (command != null) {
                this.keepRunning = false;
            }

            // Start activity
            super.startActivityForResult(intent, requestCode);
        }

        @Override
        /**
         * Called when an activity you launched exits, giving you the requestCode you started it with,
         * the resultCode it returned, and any additional data from it.
         *
         * @param requestCode       The request code originally supplied to startActivityForResult(),
         *                          allowing you to identify who this result came from.
         * @param resultCode        The integer result code returned by the child activity through its setResult().
         * @param data              An Intent, which can return result data to the caller (various data can be attached to Intent "extras").
         */
        protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent) {
            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, intent);
            CordovaPlugin callback = this.activityResultCallback;
            if (callback != null) {
                callback.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, intent);
            }
        }

Finally, remember to add the thread pool, otherwise the plugins have no threads to run on:

        @Override
        public ExecutorService getThreadPool() {
            return threadPool;
        }

6. Copy your application's HTML and JavaScript files to your Amazon Fire OS project's `/assets/www` directory.

7. Copy `config.xml` from `/framework/res/xml` to your project's `/res/xml` directory.
