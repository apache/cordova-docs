# Windows 8 Platform Guide

This guide shows how to set up your SDK development environment to
deploy Cordova apps in Windows 8.  It shows how to use either shell
tools specific to Windows 8 to generate and build apps, or the
cross-platform Cordova CLI discussed in The Command-Line Interface.
(See the Overview for a comparison of these development options.) This
section also shows how to modify Cordova apps within Visual Studio.
Regardless of which approach you take, you need to install the Visual
Studio SDK, as described below.

See Upgrading Windows 8 for information on how to upgrade existing
Windows 8 Cordova projects.

Cordova WebViews running on Windows 8 rely on Internet Explorer 10 as
their rendering engine, so as a practical matter you can use IE10's
powerful debugger to test any web content that doesn't invoke Cordova
APIs.  The Windows Phone Developer Blog provides
[helpful guidance](http://blogs.windows.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/archive/2012/11/15/adapting-your-webkit-optimized-site-for-internet-explorer-10.aspx)
on how to support IE10 along with comparable WebKit browsers.

## Requirements and Support

You need one of the following OS/SDK combinations, either from an
installation disk or an _ISO_ disk image file:

- Windows 8.0 or 8.1, 32 or 64-bit _Home_, _Pro_, or _Enterprise_
  editions, along with
  [Visual Studio 2012 Express](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads).

- Windows 8.1, 32 or 64-bit _Home_, _Pro_, or _Enterprise_ editions,
  along with 
  [Visual Studio 2013 Pro](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads)
  or higher. An evaluation version of Windows 8.1 Enterprise is
  available from the
  [Microsoft Developer Network](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/evalcenter/jj554510).

Apps compiled under Windows 8.1 do _not_ run under Windows 8.0. Apps
compiled under Windows 8.0 are forward-compatible with 8.1.

  <!-- 64-bit necessary? Pro necessary? ELSE still recommended for parallel WP dev -->

Follow the instructions at
[windowsstore.com](http://www.windowsstore.com/)
to submit the app to Windows Store.

  <!-- true? -->

To develop Cordova apps for Windows 8, you may use a PC running
Windows, but you may also develop on a Mac, either by running a
virtual machine environment or by using Boot Camp to dual-boot a
Windows 8 partition. Consult these resources to set up the required
Windows development environment on a Mac:

- [VMWare Fusion](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/windows/apps/jj945426)

- [Parallels Desktop](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/windows/apps/jj945424),
  
- [Boot Camp](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/windows/apps/jj945423).
  
## Using Cordova Shell Tools

If you want to use Cordova's Windows 8-centered shell tools in
conjunction with the SDK, you have two basic options:

- Access them locally from project code generated by the CLI. They are
  available in the `platforms/windows8/cordova` directory after you add
  the `windows8` platform as described below.

- Download them from a separate distribution at
  [cordova.apache.org](http://cordova.apache.org).  The Cordova
  distribution contains separate archives for each platform.  Be sure
  to expand the appropriate archive, `cordova-windows8\windows8` in
  this case, within an empty directory.  The relevant batch utilities
  are available in the top-level `bin` directory. (Consult the
  __README__ file if necessary for more detailed directions.)

These shell tools allow you to create, build, and run Windows 8 apps.
For information on the additional command-line interface that enables
plugin features across all platforms, see Using Plugman to Manage
Plugins.

## Install the SDK

Install the _Ultimate_, _Premium_, or _Professional_ 2013 editions of
[Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads).

## Create a New Project

At this point, to create a new project you can choose between the
cross-platform CLI tool described in The Command-Line Interface, or
the set of Windows 8-specific shell tools. From within a source-code
directory, this CLI approach generates an app named _HelloWorld_
within a new `hello` project directory:

        > cordova create hello com.example.hello HelloWorld
        > cd hello
        > cordova platform add windows8
        > cordova build

Here's the corresponding lower-level shell-tool approach:

        C:\path\to\cordova-win8\bin\create.bat C:\path\to\new\hello com.example.hello HelloWorld

## Build the Project

If you are using the CLI in development, the project directory's
top-level `www` directory contains the source files. Run either of
these within the project directory to rebuild the app:

        > cordova build
        > cordova build windows8   # do not rebuild other platforms

If you are using the Windows Phone-specific shell tools in
development, there is a different approach.  Once you generate the
project, the default app's source is available in the
`projects\windows8\www` subdirectory. Subsequent commands are available in
the `cordova` subdirectory at the same level.

The `build` command cleans project files and rebuilds the app.  The first
example generates debugging information, and the second signs the apps
for release:

        C:\path\to\project\cordova\build.bat --debug        
        C:\path\to\project\cordova\build.bat --release

The `clean` command helps flush out directories in preparation for the
next `build`:

        C:\path\to\project\cordova\clean.bat

## Open the Project in the SDK and Deploy the App

Once you build a Cordova app as described above, you can open it with
Visual Studio. The various `build` commands generate a Visual Studio
Solution (_.sln_) file. Open the file in the File Explorer to modify
the project within Visual Studio:

![](img/guide/platforms/win8/win8_sdk_openSLN.png)

The `CordovaApp` component displays within the solution, and its `www`
directory contains the web-based source code, including the
`index.html` home page:

![](img/guide/platforms/win8/win8_sdk.png)

The controls below Visual Studio's main menu allow you to test or
deploy the app:

![](img/guide/platforms/win8/win8_sdk_deploy.png)

With __Local Machine__ selected, press the green arrow to install the
app on the same machine running Visual Studio. Once you do so, the app
appears in Windows 8's app listings:

![](img/guide/platforms/win8/win8_sdk_runApp.png)

Each time you rebuild the app, the version available in the interface
is refreshed.

Once available in the app listings, holding down the __CTRL__ key
while selecting the app allows you to pin it to the main screen:

![](img/guide/platforms/win8/win8_sdk_runHome.png)

Note that if you open the app within a virtual machine environment,
you may need to click in the corners or along the sides of the windows
to switch apps or access additional functionality:

![](img/guide/platforms/win8/win8_sdk_run.png)

Alternately, choose the __Simulator__ deployment option to view the
app as if it were running on a tablet device:

![](img/guide/platforms/win8/win8_sdk_sim.png)

Unlike desktop deployment, this option allows you to simulate the
tablet's orientation, location, and vary its network settings.

__NOTE__: Consult the Overview for advice on how to use Cordova's
command-line tools or the SDK in your workflow. The Cordova CLI relies
on cross-platform source code that routinely overwrites the
platform-specific files used by the SDK. If you want to use the SDK to
modify the project, use the lower-level shell tools as an alternative
to the CLI.
