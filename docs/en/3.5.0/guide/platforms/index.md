# Platform Guides

Before developing for any of the platforms listed below, install
cordova's command-line interface (CLI).
(For details, see The Command-Line Interface.)

To develop Cordova applications, you must install SDKs for each mobile
platform you are targeting. This installation is necessary regardless
of whether you do the majority of your work in the SDK or use the CLI
for your build cycle.

Each _Platform Guide_ listed below tells you what you need to know to
set up each platform's development environment: where to obtain the
SDK, how to set up device emulators, how to connect devices for direct
testing, and how to manage signing key requirements.  Additional
guides provide information on each platform's unique set of
configuration options, instructions to add plugins, how to upgrade
each platform, and platform-specific command-line tools that serve as
a lower-level alternative to the `cordova` command-line utility.
