# Windows Phone 7 Platform Guide

This guide shows how to set up your SDK development environment to
deploy Cordova apps for Windows Phone 7 devices.  Apps also run on
Windows Phone 8 devices using the same APIs, but version 7 lacks some
of IE10's advanced features available on Windows Phone 8. Windows
Phone 8 apps do _not_ run on Windows Phone 7 devices.

See the following for more detailed platform-specific information that
applies to both versions:

* Upgrading Windows Phone
* Windows Phone Plugins
* Windows Phone Command-line Tools

The command-line tools above refer to versions prior to Cordova 3.0.
See The Command-Line Interface for information about the
current interface.

## System Requirements

Use Windows 7 or Windows 8 (Pro) or Windows Vista with SP2.  The
64-bit version (x64) of Windows is required for the SDK.  The Pro
version is recommended for running a device emulator.

Register and pay for a [Windows Phone Dev
Center](http://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/publish) account if you want
to install an app on a real device or submit it to Market Place.

__NOTE__: Running the SDK in Virtual Machine may present challenges.
Read [Windows Phone on a Mac](http://aka.ms/BuildaWP8apponaMac) for
insights on developing solutions.

## Install SDK and Cordova

Download and install the [Windows Phone
SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=27570/).

Download and extract the latest copy of
[Cordova](http://phonegap.com/download). You need to work in the
`lib\windows-phone-8\wp7` subdirectory, `lib\windows-phone-8\wp8`
contains the Windwos Phone 8 version of Cordova.

Copy the `CordovaWP7_x_x_x.zip` file to the `\My Documents\Visual
Studio 2012\Templates\ProjectTemplates\` directory.

## Building the Template

__NOTE__: Skip this step if the `lib\windows-phone` directory already
contains a `CordovaWP7_x_x_x.zip` file.

To simplify development, Cordova bundles a script to build Visual
Studio templates. These allow you to rapidly generate Cordova apps,
and you can modify them if necessary.  The steps below show how to
generate it.

### Run the Batch File to Create and Install the Templates

The root of the repo contains a `createTemplates.bat` file.
Double-clicking this file generates two `.zip` files:
`CordovaWP7_x_x_x.zip` and `CordovaWP8_x_x_x.zip`, where _3.3.0_ is
the current version number. To use these files easily in Visual
Studio, copy them to the `My Documents\Visual Studio
2012\Templates\ProjectTemplates\` subdirectory. You are then able to
create new __Apache Cordova Windows Phone_ apps from Visual Studio's
__File &rarr; New Project__ menu.

If you run the batch file from the command line, you can also call
with a parameter to install automatically:

        >createTemplates.bat -install

## Set up a New Project

- Open Visual Studio Express for Windows Phone and choose __New
  Project__.

- Select __CordovaWP7__. The version number displays in the template
  description.

- Give the project a name, and select __OK__.

## Review the Project Structure

The `www` directory features `html`, `js`, and `css` subdirectories
and any other resources your app requires.
Any additional content needs to be a part of the Visual Studio
project, and it must be set as content.

The following sample structure represents a 2.3.0 project, but may
vary depending on installed version:

## Build the Project for the Device

Before testing your application on a device, the device must be
registered. Consult
[Microsoft's documentation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff402565(v=vs.105).aspx)
for details on how to deploy and test on Windows Phone 7. These are
the basic steps:

- Make sure your phone is connected, and the screen is unlocked.

- In Visual Studio, select __Device__ from the drop-down menu at the top.

- Press the green __play__ button next to the main drop-down menu to
  start debugging, or else type __F5__.

At this point, you're done.
