# Android Configuration

The `config.xml` file controls an app's basic settings that apply
across each application and CordovaWebView instance. This section
details preferences that only apply to Android builds. See The
config.xml File for information on global configuration options.

- `KeepRunning` (boolean, defaults to `true`): Determines whether the
  application stays running in the background even after a `pause`
  event fires. Note: setting this to false will not kill the app after
  a pause event, it will only halt execution of code in the cordova
  webview while the app is in the background.

        <preference name="KeepRunning" value="false"/>

- `LoadUrlTimeoutValue` (number, default to `20000`, 20 seconds): When loading a
  page, the amount of time to wait before throwing a timeout error.
  This example specifies 10 seconds rather than 20:

        <preference name="LoadUrlTimeoutValue" value="10000"/>

- `SplashScreen`: The name of the file minus its extension in the
  `res/drawable` directory.  Various assets must share this common
  name in various subdirectories.

        <preference name="SplashScreen" value="splash"/>

- `SplashScreenDelay` (number, defaults to `5000`): The amount of
  time the splash screen image displays.

        <preference name="SplashScreenDelay" value="10000"/>

- `InAppBrowserStorageEnabled` (boolean, defaults to `true`): Controls
  whether pages opened within an InAppBrowser can access the same
  localStorage and WebSQL storage as pages opened with the default
  browser.
