# Windows Phone Command-line Tools

The `cordova` command-line utility is a high-level tool that allows
you to build applications across several platforms at once. An older
version of the Cordova framework provides sets of command-line tools
specific to each platform. To use them as an alternative to the CLI,
you need to download this version of Cordova from
[cordova.apache.org](http://cordova.apache.org). The download contains
separate archives for each platform. Expand the platform you wish to
target. The tools described here are typically available in the
top-level `bin` directory, otherwise consult the __README__ file for
more detailed directions.

For information on the low-level command-line interface that enables
plugins, see Using Plugman to Manage Plugins. See Application Plugins
for an overview.

## Windows Phone

The Windows Phone command-line tools support creating, building, and
running new projects. Commands must be run from a cmd or powershell
prompt.

The WP8 repo now includes code for building both WP7 + WP8 apps.  The
repo has subdirectories for each: `wp7/` and `wp8/`.

## Create a Project

There are 2 ways to go about creating a new Apache Cordova WP7 or WP8 application.

### Run the Batch File to Create and Install the Templates

- The root of the repo contains a `createTemplates.bat` file.
  Double-clicking it generates two `.zip` files:
  `CordovaWP7_x_x_x.zip` and `CordovaWP8_x_x_x.zip`, where _3.3.0_
  represents the current version number. To easily use these files in
  Visual Studio, copy them to `My Documents\Visual Studio
  2012\Templates\ProjectTemplates\`. You are then able to create
  new Apache Cordova Windows Phone apps from Visual Studio's
  __File &rarr; New Project__ menu.

- If you run the batch file from the command line, you can also call with a parameter to install automatically

Run the script :

    >createTemplates.bat -install

### Use the Create Scripts on the Command Line

Run the `create` command, specifying the existing path to the project,
the reverse-domain-style package identifier, and the app's display
name.  Here is the syntax for both Windows Phone 7 and 8:

    >.\wp7\bin\create PathToNewProject [ PackageName ] [ AppName ]
    >.\wp8\bin\create PathToNewProject [ PackageName ] [ AppName ]

    >PathToNewProject : The path to where you wish to create the project
    >PackageName      : The namespace for the project (default is Cordova.Example)
    >AppName          : The name of the application (default is CordovaWP8AppProj or CordovaWP7AppProj)

    >examples:
    >.\wp7\bin\create C:\path\to\my_new_project
    >.\wp8\bin\create C:\path\to\my_new_project io.cordova.example CordovaWP8App

Launch Visual Studio and open Solution file (.sln) in (C:\path\to\my_new_project)

Build and Run it

## Building the Project (Clean, then Build)

* Debug

    $ C:\path\to\my_new_project\cordova\build --debug

* Release

    $ C:\path\to\my_new_project\cordova\build --release

## Running the App

Run the 'run' command with the following *optional* parameters

* Target specification. This includes `--emulator`, `--device`, or `--target=<targetID>`.

* Build specification. This includes `--debug`, `--release`, or `--nobuild`.

    $ C:\path\to\my_new_project\cordova\run [Target] [Build]

By default the `run` command is called with `--emulator --debug` if flags are not provided.

## Cleaning

    $ C:\path\to\my_new_project\cordova\clean
