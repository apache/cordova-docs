# Splashscreen

> Displays and hides the application's splash screen.

## Methods

- splashscreen.show
- splashscreen.hide

## Accessing the Feature

As of version 3.0, Cordova implements device-level APIs as _plugins_.
Use the CLI's `plugin` command, described in The Command-Line
Interface, to add or remove this feature for a project:

        $ cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.splashscreen
        $ cordova plugin ls
        [ 'org.apache.cordova.splashscreen' ]
        $ cordova plugin rm org.apache.cordova.splashscreen

These commands apply to all targeted platforms, but modify the
platform-specific configuration settings described below:

* Amazon Fire OS (in `res/xml/config.xml`)

        <feature name="SplashScreen">
            <param name="android-package" value="org.apache.cordova.splashscreen.SplashScreen" />
        </feature>

* Android (in `res/xml/config.xml`)

        <feature name="SplashScreen">
            <param name="android-package" value="org.apache.cordova.splashscreen.SplashScreen" />
        </feature>

* BlackBerry 10 (in `www/config.xml`)

        <feature name="SplashScreen" value="SplashScreen" />

* iOS (in the named application directory's `config.xml`)

        <feature name="SplashScreen">
            <param name="ios-package" value="CDVSplashScreen" />
        </feature>

Some platforms may support this feature without requiring any special
configuration.  See Platform Support for an overview.

See Icons and Splash Screens for information on how to configures these images.
