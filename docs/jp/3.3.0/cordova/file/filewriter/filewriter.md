# FileWriter

As object that allows you to create and write data to a file.

## Properties

- __readyState__: One of the three possible states, either `INIT`, `WRITING`, or `DONE`.

- __fileName__: The name of the file to be written. _(DOMString)_

- __length__: The length of the file to be written. _(long)_

- __position__: The current position of the file pointer. _(long)_

- __error__: An object containing errors. _(FileError)_

- __onwritestart__: Called when the write starts. _(Function)_

- __onwrite__: Called when the request has completed successfully.  _(Function)_

- __onabort__: Called when the write has been aborted. For instance, by invoking the abort() method. _(Function)_

- __onerror__: Called when the write has failed. _(Function)_

- __onwriteend__: Called when the request has completed (either in success or failure).  _(Function)_

The following property is _not_ supported:

- __onprogress__: Called while writing the file, reporting progress in terms of `progress.loaded`/`progress.total`. _(Function)_
## Methods

- __abort__: Aborts writing the file.

- __seek__: Moves the file pointer to the specified byte.

- __truncate__: Shortens the file to the specified length.

- __write__: Writes data to the file.

## Details

The `FileWriter` object offers a way to write UTF-8 encoded files to
the device file system.  Applications respond to `writestart`,
`progress`, `write`, `writeend`, `error`, and `abort` events.

Each `FileWriter` corresponds to a single file, to which data can be
written many times.  The `FileWriter` maintains the file's `position`
and `length` attributes, which allow the app to `seek` and `write`
anywhere in the file. By default, the `FileWriter` writes to the
beginning of the file, overwriting existing data. Set the optional
`append` boolean to `true` in the `FileWriter`'s constructor to
write to the end of the file.

Text data is supported by all platforms listed below. Text is encoded as UTF-8 before being written to the filesystem. Some platforms also support binary data, which can be passed in as either an ArrayBuffer or a Blob.

## Supported Platforms

Text and Binary Support:

- Amazon Fire OS
- Android
- iOS

Text-only Support:

- BlackBerry 10
- Windows Phone 7 and 8
- Windows 8

## Seek Quick Example

    function win(writer) {
        // fast forwards file pointer to end of file
        writer.seek(writer.length);
    };

    var fail = function(evt) {
        console.log(error.code);
    };

    entry.createWriter(win, fail);

## Truncate Quick Example

    function win(writer) {
        writer.truncate(10);
    };

    var fail = function(evt) {
        console.log(error.code);
    };

    entry.createWriter(win, fail);

## Write Quick Example

    function win(writer) {
        writer.onwrite = function(evt) {
            console.log("write success");
        };
        writer.write("some sample text");
    };

    var fail = function(evt) {
        console.log(error.code);
    };

    entry.createWriter(win, fail);

## Binary Write Quick Example

    function win(writer) {
        var data = new ArrayBuffer(5),
            dataView = new Int8Array(data);
        for (i=0; i < 5; i++) {
            dataView[i] = i;
        }
        writer.onwrite = function(evt) {
            console.log("write success");
        };
        writer.write(data);
    };

    var fail = function(evt) {
        console.log(error.code);
    };

    entry.createWriter(win, fail);

## Append Quick Example

    function win(writer) {
        writer.onwrite = function(evt) {
        console.log("write success");
    };
    writer.seek(writer.length);
        writer.write("appended text");
    };

    var fail = function(evt) {
        console.log(error.code);
    };

    entry.createWriter(win, fail);

## Abort Quick Example

    function win(writer) {
        writer.onwrite = function(evt) {
            console.log("write success");
        };
        writer.write("some sample text");
        writer.abort();
    };

    var fail = function(evt) {
        console.log(error.code);
    };

    entry.createWriter(win, fail);
