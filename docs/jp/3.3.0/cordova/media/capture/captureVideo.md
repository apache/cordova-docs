# capture.captureVideo

> Start the video recorder application and return information about captured video clip files.

    navigator.device.capture.captureVideo(
        CaptureCB captureSuccess, CaptureErrorCB captureError, [CaptureVideoOptions options]
    );

## Description

Starts an asynchronous operation to capture video recordings using the
device's video recording application.  The operation allows the user
to capture more than one recordings in a single session.

The capture operation ends when either the user exits the video
recording application, or the maximum number of recordings specified
by `CaptureVideoOptions.limit` is reached.  If no `limit` parameter
value is specified, it defaults to one (1), and the capture operation
terminates after the user records a single video clip.

When the capture operation finishes, it the `CaptureCB` callback
executes with an array of `MediaFile` objects describing each captured
video clip file.  If the user terminates the operation before
capturing a video clip, the `CaptureErrorCB` callback executes with a
`CaptureError` object featuring a
`CaptureError.CAPTURE_NO_MEDIA_FILES` error code.

## Supported Platforms

- Amazon Fire OS
- Android
- BlackBerry 10
- iOS
- Windows Phone 7 and 8
- Windows 8

## Quick Example

    // capture callback
    var captureSuccess = function(mediaFiles) {
        var i, path, len;
        for (i = 0, len = mediaFiles.length; i < len; i += 1) {
            path = mediaFiles[i].fullPath;
            // do something interesting with the file
        }
    };

    // capture error callback
    var captureError = function(error) {
        navigator.notification.alert('Error code: ' + error.code, null, 'Capture Error');
    };

    // start video capture
    navigator.device.capture.captureVideo(captureSuccess, captureError, {limit:2});

## BlackBerry 10 Quirks

- Cordova for BlackBerry 10 attempts to launch the __Video Recorder__ application, provided by RIM, to capture video recordings. The app receives a `CaptureError.CAPTURE_NOT_SUPPORTED` error code if the application is not installed on the device.
