# CaptureAudioOptions

> Encapsulates audio capture configuration options.

## Properties

- __limit__: The maximum number of audio clips the device user can record in a single capture operation.  The value must be greater than or equal to 1 (defaults to 1).

- __duration__: The maximum duration of an audio sound clip, in seconds.

## Quick Example

    // limit capture operation to 3 media files, no longer than 10 seconds each
    var options = { limit: 3, duration: 10 };

    navigator.device.capture.captureAudio(captureSuccess, captureError, options);

## Amazon Fire OS Quirks

- The `duration` parameter is not supported.  Recording lengths cannot be limited programmatically.

## Android Quirks

- The `duration` parameter is not supported.  Recording lengths can't be limited programmatically.

## BlackBerry 10 Quirks

- The `duration` parameter is not supported.  Recording lengths can't be limited programmatically.

## iOS Quirks

- The `limit` parameter is not supported, so only one recording can be created for each invocation.
