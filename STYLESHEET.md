# Editorial Style Sheet

Developers contributing to Cordova are already familiar with coding
best practices.  What you'll find here are best practices when writing
tech doc addressed to Cordova developers.

There are two basic kinds of tech doc: reference content and
expository "guide" content. Reference doc tends to be self-contained,
descriptive, and scoped without context: e.g., detailing an API
interface and its members.  Guide content is prescriptive, linear, and
part of a larger story. How do you typically use the API (or
whatever), what do you need to know first, what are the limits to what
you can use it for, etc. Guide content is oriented more around tasks,
common use cases, or especially now in Cordova's case, alternative
workflows.  It may not be obvious, but if you first ask yourself what
purpose the doc you're editing serves, it improves its quality
immensely.

## Structure and Flow

* __Valid Heading Structure__: One title only (an A-head) at the top
  of the page.  No jumps to C-heads. Do not follow a heading with a
  subheading with no intervening introductory text.

* __Flatten Content__: Use B-heads to divide each page's content. Please
  avoid C-heads; readers tend to lose context once content gets that
  nested.

* __Provide Context__: Each page of expository doc should start with a
  short paragraph summarizing the subject matter, and serving as
  necessary connective tissue.  Link to other related & prerequisite
  topics, especially for likely workflow scenarios.  E.g., Plugman doc
  is most appropriate for platform-specific shell-tool workflow, not
  for the CLI even though it underlies it invisibly.

* __Consistent Headings__: Try to match verb tense in headings. That
  is, if one is task-based and reads "Adding a Platform," the other
  should be "Developing for Android" rather than "Android Development"

* __Heading Content__: In reference doc, preserve case in titles and
  headings.  In guide doc: Initial Cap Words in Headings, Except for
  Short Prepositions or Conjunctions. Also Init-Cap Around Hyphens.
  No punctuation at the end of a heading; avoid punctuation within
  headings.  Do not prefix headings with numbers.

* __Heading Fonts__: In reference doc, do not apply font formatting to
  standalone member names such as compass.getCurrentHeading. Minimize
  font changes within headings. If necessary, only apply italic.

* __Listings__: Use numbered lists for sequential procedures or ranked
  content only, otherwise use bullet lists.  Precede lists with text
  that introduces them, preferably ending with a colon (:).  Do not
  allow single-item lists.  Use bullet lists only to indicate a clear
  set of choices that you first introduce, not as a substitute for
  regular paragraphs.  Avoid nested lists, for the same reason you
  avoid C-heads. Do not nest top-level lists for additional
  indentation.

* __Punctuating and Formatting Lists__: Append periods to bullet and
  number list items that consist of full sentences. No periods when
  bullet items are sentence fragments, except in bullet lists that
  need internal consistency. To improve readability, add vertical
  space around top-level bullet/numbered list items that consist of
  full sentences. OK to vertically collapse lists of short, easily
  scannable items.

* __Procedure Lists__: Don't break out separate procedure items for
  (1) do this, followed by (2) this describes what just happened.
  Prefer (1) Do this. It does so-and-so, which you might see in some
  result. (2) Do that...

* __Topic/Comment Lists__: For bullet lists that provide short topics
  followed by comments, bold the topic, then merge the comment on the
  same line, separated with a colon unless the topic features trailing
  punctuation. This list item provides an example. Bolded Topic Text
  Follows Same Init-Cap Rule as Headings.

* __Notes__: Bold & all-cap __NOTE__:, with colon outside, always at
  the start of a paragraph, never mid-paragraph. <!--RE :__--> Do not
  incorporate this font change into a sentence as in "__Note__
  that..." but OK to start a sentence: "Note that..." when the
  information is less consequential. Do not apply bullet/number list
  formatting.  <!--RE- __NOTE-->

* __Warnings/Tips__: As an alternative to __NOTE__:, use __WARNING__:
  for serious matters, or __TIP__: to pass along useful tricks or
  context.

* __Minimize Notes__: Avoid too many notes and warnings, as it implies
  a haphazard development environment with too many variable factors
  that divert the reader's attention. Try to clarify variations on a
  procedure within the text.

<!--
* __Platform-Specific Notes__ __ios__: ???
-->

## Language and Tone

* __Not So Imperitive__: As a rule of thumb, avoid the word "must" and
  unnecessarily imperative statements in general.  E.g., instead of
  "Commands must be run from a cmd or powershell prompt," try "You can
  run commands either from a cmd or powershell prompt."

* __Avoid the Willies__: Use present tense. "This happens," not "this
  will happen." Future tense comes off as a tenuous prediction. Rule
  of thumb: avoid the word "will."

* __Avoid Passive Voice__: Past-tense passive voice is to be avoided.
  E.g., "the pause event fires when..."  rather than "the pause event
  is fired when..." Rule of thumb: banish verbs ending in "ed".
  Passive voice is more appropriate for reference doc, you should
  still avoid it when there's a better active-voice alternative.

* __Not Kidding, Use Present Tense__: Minimize verbs ending with
  "ing": "This is necessary to provide...", not "This is necessary for
  providing..." <!-- are\s-+[a-z]+ing\b -->

* __Use Action Verbs__: Avoid weak verbs like "is" or "has." The
  sentence in the item above could stand improvement.

* __Noun Phrase Jargon__: Avoid noun modification concatenation
  somnambulation obfuscation.  Use your judgement and ask yourself if
  readers might not actually know what some noun phrase means. If so,
  explain the actual concept it represents, in this case: "Avoid
  stringing nouns together into long phrases that come off as
  impenetrable shop talk that puts everybody to sleep."

* __Use Possessives__: Possessives sound more familiar and colloquial:
  "the device's home screen" rather than clumsier: "the home screen of
  the device"

* __The Brothers Karmazov__: 'The FOO file', not 'the file FOO', no
  matter how long FOO's path is.

* __Serial comma__: This, that, and the other.

* Do not drop articles: "In the Bada IDE", not "In Bada IDE"

* Do not start a sentence with a lowercase member name. E.g., "Does
  not support `filter`" rather than "`filter` is not supported"
  <!--RE \. `-->

* Do not refer to "I," the author of the documentation, as in "What I
  am going to show you now." Likewise avoid "we" and "let's," so
  instead of "We see that..." try "Note that..." Readers want to focus
  on the thing they're working on, not on you. <!--RE \bI\b-->

* OK to refer to "you," the developer, but only sparingly, e.g., to
  avoid passive voice. Also do not use "your" as a routine substitute
  for "the" or "a" when referring to a noun.

* Avoid em dash clauses--they unnecessarily break up the text--and
  parenthical statements (which can also be distracting). If you do
  include either, remove spaces around the dashes (punctuate fragments
  outside of paren's). (Punctuate full sentences inside of parens.)

* This Guide or section, not this document, page, or anything else

## In-line Font Formatting

* Use `monospace` for all-purpose nouns used in programming, e.g.: API
  interfaces, methods, properties, literal values, Unix commands,
  pathnames, filenames, etc.

* Use __bold__ for on-screen items, such as the names of menu items,
  buttons, and check boxes.

* Use _italics_ for emphasis, simple mathematical expressions, and
  variable items (e.g., _x_/_y_ coordinates).

* Do _not_ use ALL CAPS for emphasis. (Exception: in commented code)

* Do _not_ use "quote characters" to deliniate in-line text unless
  required as part of a value. E.g., not OK to refer to the
  "text-align" property. OK to set the CSS `text-align` property to
  `left`, and the `content` property to `"This is some text."`
  (Exception: within code comments)

* Do not combine in-line formatting such as _`monospace italic`_.

* Use the markup system's shorthand characters rather than embedded
  HTML `<em>...</em>` or `<code>...</code>`.

## Usage

* "User" may refer to the end user, not to an application's
  "developer." Refer to plural "users" as "they" to avoid singular
  he/she pronoun problems. Also avoid "his" and "her".
  <!--RE\bs?he\b--> <!--RE\b(his|her)\b-->

* WebView, not Webview. (OK to use lowercase webview in code)

* "Plugman" in generic references, "plugman" when referring to actual
  utility.

* metadata.

* Xcode.

* "splash screen" unless specifically referring to API.

* 'Directory', not 'folder'; may be exceptions in some GUI contexts

* Prefer "can't" over "cannot"; sounds more relaxed. <!--RE cannot-->

* Subdirectory, not sub-directory

* 'Press' a button on the screen; 'type' a key; do not 'hit' either.

* 'Set up' as verb, 'setup' as noun.

* 'Handheld' not 'hand held'

* Filename, not file name

* 'JavaScript' (but lowercase when MIME type)

* Unix, not unix

* Mac "OS X", not "OSX"

* BlackBerry, not Blackberry

* "BlackBerry 10," not "BlackBerry10"

* Prefer "emulator" over "simulator"; clarify when interfaces refer to
  them differently.

* Use "app" for mobile apps, and "application" for desktop. E.g., you
  may use the Xcode application to help you write an iOS Cordova app.
  Consider "app" a valid word rather than a contraction, so use "apps"
  rather than "app's" as plural.

* Likewise, "repo" is OK to substitute for "repository"

* Prefer generic "SDK" over "IDE", or "SDK tools" when referring to
  dedicated GUI coding environments such as Eclipse. (OK to refer to
  specific tools as IDEs if that's how they self-identify.)

* Remove superfluous "navigate to" wherever possible, unless you need
  to `cd` to a particular directory to launch a command. Instead of
  "Navigate to the D directory and edit the F file," prefer: "Edit the
  _D/F_ file."

* An XML/HTML 'element' rather than 'tag'

* It's a "method" when called on an object. Refer to "function" only
  when unspecified, e.g. a "callback function" may also be implemented
  as an object method.

* Use parentheses when referring to `method()` and `function()` names.
  (Exception: when assigning a reference to the object rather than
  calling it as a method.)

* Spell out "and" and "or"; do not substitute with "&" or "/" in text

* "and/or" is unnecessary; "or" usually makes that implicit.

* Avoid unnecessary/gratuitous slash-delimited alternators in text, as
  in this example (but OK to refer to try/catch blocks).

* Avoid trailing (s) to denote optional plural. It's usually implicit.
  E.g., "return information about captured image files", not "file(s)"

* Avoid the word "multiple" wherever possible.  It's one of those
  unnecessary words up there with "myriad" or "plethora." What's wrong
  with "several"?

## Punctuation

* Append colon to text that introduces a code snippet or image.

* Use `&amp;rarr;` arrow entities (&rarr;) for hierarchical menus or
  sequences of nested dialog boxes.

## Common Grammatical Errors

* __Hyphenate Adjective Phrases__: E.g., "command-line tools", but not
  when it's a noun, as in "the command line."

* __It's a Crazy Language, but its Rules Eventually Make Sense__:
  Hyphenate "it's" only for "it is," not for possessive.

* __Plural Possessives__: E.g., Obtain a user's permission, but
  collectively, get users' permission.

* Do not use apostrophes for plural, so "...manages core APIs,"
  not api's or API's. Only use apostrophes for possessives, e.g. "the
  API's members"

* "applications" not "app's" for plural

* Do not hyphenate adverbs, as it's implict they modify verbs.  So,
  "commonly seen problems," not "commonly-seen problems"

* Use semicolons to separate short, closely related clauses that can
  stand alone grammatically as full sentences. Use commas to separate
  clauses where one is a sentence fragment. E.g., "This is a clause,
  along with this." vs.  "This can serve as a sentence; this can too."

* If a sentence with semicolons runs on tool long, it's time to break
  it out into separate sentences. Rewrite this...  "This can serve as
  a sentence; this can too, along with related information."  ...as...
  "This can serve as a sentence. This can too, along with related
  information."

* This is can serve as a sentence and this can also serve as a
  sentence but you need to use commas to separate this big mess.

## Content-specific

* Refer to the default app as "Hello World", regardless of what it
  actually displays.

* Refer to the default plugin demo as "Echo"

* Keep the term "hybrid" app confined to two scenarios: (1) an app
  whose developer has to supply components that bridge native &
  webview, e.g., custom plugins, or an embedded webview component. (2)
  An app with an InAppBrowser, that is a web-based app that itself
  opens a web page. Don't apply to a garden-variety "cross-platform"
  app that is Cordova's bread & butter.

## Links

* Use titles in link text, never 'click here'. Consider using the
  link's domain name as a substitute. <!--RE here]-->

* Domain names are OK as a link's display text, but not full
  scheme-qualified URLs. No bare URLs in text outside of code.
  <!--RE \[http -->

## Miscellaneous

* In body text, no ( extra space inside parens ). OK to increase
  readability of code.

* OK to use shorthand notation for version ranges, e.g. "5.0+" rather
  than "(OS 5.0 and higher)"

* Use space characters rather than tabs in code blocks.
