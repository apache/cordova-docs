We are happy to announce that `cordova@13.0.0` has been released! This is the latest version of the Cordova command-line interface (CLI) used for creating and building Cordova apps.

* [cordova@13.0.0 on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova/v/13.0.0)

**To upgrade a global installation:**

```bash
npm uninstall -g cordova
npm install -g cordova@latest
```

Note: If you are installing Cordova locally in a project (not globally), simply omit the `-g` flag.

## Release Highlights

The most notable changes in this major release include:

* Updated npm dependencies.
* Increased Node.js engine requirement to `>=20.17.0 || >=22.9.0`.
* Removed `telemetry`.

One of the main dependencies that was updated is **cordova-lib**, which for provides the core CLI functionality for managing platforms and plugins, including adding and removing them. Among the breaking changes in this release, the `cordova serve` command has been removed.
