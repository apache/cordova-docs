We are happy to announce that Cordova node xcode `1.1.0` version was released in December 2018.

## Release Highlights

The purpose of this patch release is to include the following updates:

* feat: omit objects with empty values ([#24](https://github.com/apache/cordova-node-xcode/pull/24))
* Resolve issue with `pbxFile` extension ([#31](https://github.com/apache/cordova-node-xcode/pull/31))
* uuid@3 update ([#40](https://github.com/apache/cordova-node-xcode/pull/40))

* Fixed bug where comment is not removed on removing embedded frameworks. ([#5](https://github.com/apache/cordova-node-xcode/pull/5))

## Deprecation Note

As NodeJS 4.x support ended on April 30<sup>th</sup>, 2018, we are proceeding with our [previously announced](http://cordova.apache.org/news/2016/10/01/0.x-4.x-deprecation-timeline.html) deprecation timeline.  This is possibly the last release that will support Node.js 4.x.
