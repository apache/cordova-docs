## Deprecation of the Cordova OSX Platform

We are hereby annoucing the deprecation of [cordova-osx](https://github.com/apache/cordova-osx#readme).

This means that the Cordova development community will not be doing any more work on this platform. Please migrate to the `cordova-electron` platform or try Mac Catalyst with the `cordova-ios` platform.

The usage and activity around the osx platform have been quite low for a long time. Cordova's other solutions for building apps for macOS are actively maintained and especially cordova-ios offers better plugin support.

Your feedback is graciously accepted and appreciated!
