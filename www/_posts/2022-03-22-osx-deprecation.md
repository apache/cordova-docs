## Deprecation of the Cordova OSX Platform

We are hereby annoucing the deprecation of [cordova-osx](https://github.com/apache/cordova-osx/blob/master/README.md#deprecation-notice).

This means that the Cordova development community will not be doing any more work on this platform. Please migrate to the `cordova-electron` platform or try Mac Catalyst with the `cordova-ios` platform.

The usage and activity around the osx platform have been quite low for a long time. Cordovas other solutions for building apps for macOS offer better plugin support and are actively maintained.

Your feedback is graciously accepted and appreciated!
