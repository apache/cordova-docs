We are happy to announce the release of `cordova-windows 6.0.0`. 

This is a major release that changes functionality you might rely on, so please make sure to read the following list of changes:

## Changes

- **Windows 10 / UWP** builds are now default, meaning `cordova build windows` will now build a Windows 10 UWP app by default. Windows (Phone) 8.1 is still supported, of course, just use `cordova build windows -- --appx=8.1-win`, `cordova build windows -- --appx=8.1-phone` or an equivalent configuration option.
- You can now build apps with a current installation of **Visual Studio 2017** (`15.5.x` at the time of writing) without any additional configuration or hacks (like the environment variable `VSINSTALLDIR` that was required for 5.0.0).
    - Note: [Visual Studio 2017 doesn't support Windows 8.1 apps anymore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/productinfo/vs2017-compatibility-vs#windows-store-and-windows-phone-apps), so you can only build these apps with Visual Studio 2015 installed.
- New **ENV variable `MSBUILDDIR`** allows to directly configure the MSBuild Tools to be used to build the app. While `VSINSTALLDIR` always has been a hack that accidentally also worked to switch between different MSBuildTools versions, we now we this functionality explicit:  Just set the ENV var to a your desired MSBuild folder (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\bin\`) and it will be used to build your project. 
    - If you have Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2015 installed at the same time, the normal logic would always choose Visual Studio 2017's MSBuild 15 - and fail on a Windows (Phone) 8.1 project. If you set the environment variable MSBuild 14, it can successfully build your 8.1 apps.
    - If the supplied path is invalid or doesn't contain a working MSBuild, the normal MSBuild selection logic will be triggered
- Fixes several bugs

## Installation

As usual, this new version will be added as the default `cordova-windows` version for `cordova platform add windows` only with the next release of Cordova CLI. Until then, please use these commands to remove and re-add the `windows` platform:

```
cordova platform rm windows
cordova platform add windows@6.0.0
```

### Known limitations

As it's often the case, the `6.0.0` release of cordova-windows is not perfect and has some known limitations:

- If you only have Visual Studio 2017 installed on your machine, you can not build Windows (Phone) 8.1 apps.
- As with earlier versions, Windows 10 Mobile emulators are not supported by the CLI but require Visual Studio to be used to build the app
- Some [`build`](https://github.com/apache/cordova-windows/issues/266) and [requirements error messages](https://github.com/apache/cordova-windows/issues/267) are not optimal

## Feedback

If you encounter problems with this new version, you can use the [GitHub issues of the `cordova-windows` repository](https://github.com/apache/cordova-windows/issues) to do so now. (`cordova-windows` is the first Apache Cordova repository on GitHub that uses issues on GitHub instead of [JIRA issues](http://issues.cordova.io/)!)

## The future of `cordova-windows`

Working on this update reminded us how much code there is to support other platform variants besides Windows 10 Desktop / UWP, specifically Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 but also Windows 10 Mobile.

As Microsoft recently ended mainstream support for all **Windows 8.1** variants, total market share recedes below 6% and Visual Studio 2017 doesn't support 8.1 development anymore, we don't expect any future changes that would require updates to `cordova-windows`' 8.1 support. Same for **Windows 10 Mobile**, which is not under active development by Microsoft anymore and will not receive any other updates than security fixes.

Because of that, we decided to **deprecate all "mobile" and "phone" build targets of `cordova-windows`**. In the near future, we will release a `7.0.0` version that will remove support for those platform variants and focus on Windows 10 UWP - which will greatly reduce complexity and simplify future maintenance.  
`cordova-windows 6.0.0` with support for these platforms, of course, will stay available and receive bugfixes if necessary (Similar to how `cordova-windows@4` was the last version to support Windows 8.0).

Please tell us in the comments to this blog post if you have any objections or comments to these plans.
