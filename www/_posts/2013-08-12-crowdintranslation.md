Apache Cordova is going global!  Apache Cordova is already being used by
developers all over the world and now, we are proud to announce, the Apache
Cordova documentation will be translated into a number of languages.  But we
need your help!  With the support of <a href="http://crowdin.net/project/cordova">Crowdin</a>, a translation and
localization management platform, translators can login to the easy-to-use
tooling and provide as much or as little translation assistance as they would
like.  If you know another language please support Cordova and contribute.
