We'd like to announce that we have deprecated and will be removing all translated docs.

We had been providing translated docs since Cordova CLI 3.1.0 but, the number of resources has decreased to a point where it affects our ability to maintain them. The maintenance of these translated docs started to diverge around Cordova CLI 6.x.

We have updated our webserver to redirect the language docs to their English counterparts. A 404 page will display only when the English counterparts do not exist. This issue occurs when translated docs continue to show deprecated content. For example, the BlackBerry 10 platform was deprecated and removed from Cordova CLI 8.x but, the translations were not updated and still show the deprecated platform.

We'd like to thank the people who took the initiative in creating the translated docs and those who had put in their time and effort into maintaining them.

For non-English speakers, we received feedback from various users that using services such as Google Translate to translate the English documentation into their language has produced better readable content over the existing translated docs. If you are using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, you could right-click and translate the page into your language.

We strive to provide our community with better documentation, so at this time, we will be focusing on improving our English documentation. In the distant future, when we have more resources or better alternative solutions, we may once again return to tackling the challenges of providing language documentation.
