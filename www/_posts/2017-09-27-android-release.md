We are happy to announce that `Cordova Android 6.3.0` has been released! 

This release now targets the latest Android API level of API 26 and has fixed issues related to the **Android SDK Tools 26.0.2** release. **Google** changed how the Android emulator was executed, causing errors when deploying to the emulator. 

This release contains the integration of `cordova-plugin-compat`, so please remove that plugin from projects once you update to this version of `cordova-android`.

To upgrade:

    npm install -g cordova
    cd my_project
    cordova platform update android@6.3.0

To add it explicitly:

    cordova platform add android@6.3.0
