We are happy to announce that we have just released a major update for `cordova-plugin-camera`!

* [cordova-plugin-camera@8.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-camera)

**To upgrade:**

```bash
cordova plugin remove cordova-plugin-camera
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-camera@8.0.0
```

## Release Highlights

This is a major update as it includes some breaking public API mechanisms, for
the better!

The breaking changes includes:
- [getPicture](#getpicture)
- [URI Persistence](#uri-persistence)
- [Optional WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE](#optional-write_external_storage-permission)

Additionally the `allowEdit` feature is now deprecated. [See more details](#deprecation-allowedit).


### getPicture

The Camera plugin previously was very inconsistent with the return paths when
using `getPicture` API. Sometimes it was `file://` uri, sometimes it was a raw
file path. Applications would have to check and usually prefix the path
themselves to make any use of them. So we've streamlined the returned data as
URIs.

All platforms consistently return a `<scheme>:...` now.

For all platforms, when using the `DATA_URL` option, the returned base64 encoded
image used to return just the base64 encoded part. As of v8.0.0, the returned
string now includes the `data:` uri header, including the MIME type that the
base64 data represents.

For iOS, `file://` uris were always previously returned consistently therefore,
no changes were made here.

For Android, the API behaved consistently depending on the underlying source of
the content. Most of the time a raw file path was returned. It will now always
return a URI of some sort, though unlike iOS, it is unsafe to assume it will be
a `file://` uri.

If you were testing and prefixing your file paths, you are no longer required to.
All URIs returned when using `FILE_URI` option is resolvable by 
cordova-plugin-file@8.1.2` and later.

For examples on how to use the results, see the
[Camera Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera?tab=readme-ov-file#take-a-picture-and-get-a-fileentry-object-)

### URI Persistence

For all platforms using `FILE_URI` option, the returned URI is **temporarily access** only.

When sourcing content from the camera, the file is stored in the app's temporary
directory, which the OS may clear out at any time when disk space is sparse.

<!-- For iOS, this might not be completely accurate, but for the sake of making
the blog brief/simple, I'm omitting this fact -->
When sourcing content from the user's gallery, the returned URI has a
temporarily read permission provided by the OS which expires typically once the
application exits.

This means that the URI returned by `getPicture` should not be stored. The
application should decide what to do with it depending on their needs and
requirements.

**Example 1:** The application is receiving an image for the user's profile
picture and it will require persistent access to that content.

Solution: The application should copy the content to the app's data directory
and store and use the copied URI instead.

**Example 2:** The application is receiving an image to edit or make
manipulations. It just needs one-time read to load into memory to put the data
in an image editor.

Solution: The application can safely use the temporarily URI to read and display
the content and save the manipulated data later.

### Optional WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE Permission

For Android 7 - 12, this plugin used to always include the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
permission, and for implementation reasons it was required to operate.

As of v8.0.0, the Camera plugin no longer automatically includes the permission
declaration, as in most cases it is no longer required.

If your application enables the `saveToPhotoAlbum` option, then you'll need to
add the following to the `config.xml` file:

```xml
<platform name="android">
    <config-file target="AndroidManifest.xml" parent="/*" xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" android:maxSdkVersion="28" />
    </config-file>
</platform>
```

If your application does not use `saveToPhotoAlbum`, then your application does
not require any permissions to operate both the camera, or picking from the
user's gallery.

Attempting to use `saveToPhotoAlbum` without declaring the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
will result in an error being returned on Android 7, Android 8, and Android 9 devices.

### Deprecation: allowEdit

The `allowEdit` feature when capturing images from the camera, or selecting
images from the gallery is now deprecated. Behaviour of this feature was
inconsistent across platforms, and often times is unreliable as it was dependent
on support of the underlying Camera application which was not standard.

The feature still exists for the time being and should work as-is given it's
documented caveats, but Apache Cordova will no longer provide support for issues
arising from using the feature. The `allowEdit` option is scheduled to be
completely removed at a later date with no direct replacement.

Users using the `allowEdit` feature should move to a dedicated image
manipulation library.

### Known Issues

#### iOS 

The `FileEntry.toURL` method on iOS does not produce a DOM-usable uri while
the application is configured to use schemes. A [fix](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/pull/642)
for this will be available at an later date. In the meantime, the following can
be used as a workaround:

```javascript
// TODO: Remove when https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/pull/642 is released
function toDomURL(fileEntry) {
    if (cordova.platform === "ios") {
        return window.WkWebView.convertFilePath(fileEntry.nativeUrl);
    }
    else {
        return fileEntry.toURL();
    }
}
```

If your app is still hosted on the `file://` protocol on iOS, then the
workaround is not necessary.

#### Android

Android will start returning `content://` instead of `file://` URIs when
selecting images from the user's gallery in order to make use of the underlying
MediaStore APIs. In order for these paths to be resolvable to a DOM-usable URL,
the `AndroidInsecureFileModeEnabled` preference must be `"false"` (the default value).
