We kicked off 2025 with a very successful virtual meetup! Thank you to everyone who attended, and a huge thanks to Bryan Ellis (@erisu) for preparing and hosting the meeting. We had over 100 registrations and more than 60 attendees.

The recording is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxZsVWJ8AT8), and you can find the slides [here](https://www.erisu.dev/slides/cordova-meetup-2025/).

Bryan provided a recap of 2024, summarizing Cordova releases and milestones, and shared some plans for the current year. As always, we can't provide exact timelines since our work is entirely volunteer-driven. However, if youâ€™d like to help us achieve our goals, you can start contributing at any time!

We also have plans for additional meetups to make contributing even more accessible. Stay tuned for more details!
