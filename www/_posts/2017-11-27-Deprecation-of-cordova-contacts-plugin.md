## Deprecation of the Cordova Contacts Plugin

We are hereby announcing the deprecation of cordova-plugin-contacts. 

This means that the Cordova development community will not be doing any more work on this plugin. You can continue to use this plugin as-is in existing and new applications but any further issues will not be fixed by the Cordova team.

Generally when we deprecate plugins, we have an alternative standards API to migrate to, however, the latest [W3C Contacts API](https://www.w3.org/TR/contacts-api/) indicates that the work on implementing a standard has been discontinued because of various privacy and security issues. Some of the main issues are potential compromise of users' contacts, safe and timely disposal of contact information by the recipient and inadvertent granting of permission by the user.



Your feedback is graciously accepted and appreciated!
