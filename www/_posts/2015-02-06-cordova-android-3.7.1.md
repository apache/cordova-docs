We are happy to announce that `Cordova Android 3.7.1` has been released!

This release has numerous bug fixes, and sets the target-sdk to android-21 (which yields a pretty good graphics speed-up on Lollipop devices!). It will be the default Android version when the cordova-cli 4.1.0 is released.

To upgrade:

    npm install -g cordova
    cd my_project
    cordova platform update android@3.7.1

To add it explicitly:

    cordova platform add android@3.7.1



For non-CLI projects or for pre-3.0 projects, refer to the [upgrade guides](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/guide_platforms_index.md.html).
