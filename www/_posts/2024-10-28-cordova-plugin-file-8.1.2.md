We are happy to announce that we have just released an update for `cordova-plugin-file`!

* [cordova-plugin-file@8.1.2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-file)

**To upgrade:**

```bash
cordova plugin remove cordova-plugin-file
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-file@8.1.2
```

## Release Highlights

This patch is a regression fix. See [8.1.1 release blog](https://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2024/10/23/cordova-plugin-file-8.1.1.html) post for more details.

In 8.1.1, the `FileEntry.toURL()` method broke when used on any `file://` that didn't lead to the app's internal assets on Android. This is now corrected.

This bug didn't effect iOS devices.
