We are happy to announce that we have just released `Cordova Browser 6.0.0`! This is one of Cordova's supported platforms for building browser targeted applications.

* [cordova-browser@6.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-browser)

## Release Highlights

As NodeJS 4.x support has been dropped by the NodeJS team on April 30th, 2018, we have raised the minimum required NodeJS version for this release to 6.x.

Please report any issues you find at [issues.cordova.io](http://issues.cordova.io/)!
