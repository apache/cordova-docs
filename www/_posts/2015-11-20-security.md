Two older vulerabilities were brought to our attention, and while we found that they were fixed in later versions of Cordova, we are required to announce these
vulnerabilities, and to encourage users to upgrade to a supported version of Cordova, the lowest stable version currently being Android 4.1.0.  We are no longer supporting
Cordova-Android 3.x due to security issues related to the legacy whitelist implementation, and we recommend that users upgrade to Cordova Android 5.0.x for Marshmallow support.

When using the Cordova CLI, the command to use 4.1.0 of Cordova Android is:

    cordova platform add android@4.1.0

The security issues are CVE-2015-5256 and CVE-2015-5257

For your convenience, the text of the CVEs are included here.

____

CVE-2015-5256: Apache Cordova vulnerable to improper application of whitelist restrictions on Android

Severity: Medium

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Cordova Android 3.7.2 and earlier

Description:
Android applications created using Apache Cordova that use a remote server contain a vulnerability where whitelist restrictions are not properly applied.
Improperly crafted URIs could be used to circumvent the whitelist, allowing for the execution of non-whitelisted Javascript.

Upgrade path:
Developers who are concerned about this should rebuild their applications with Cordova Android 4.1.1.  Developers using remote content roots should also
use SSL, as well as Content Source Policy to further mitigate this issue.

CVE-2015-5257: Weak Randomization of BridgeSecret for Apache Cordova Android

Severity: Low

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Cordova Android versions up to 3.6.4

Description:

Cordova uses a bridge that allows the Native Application to communicate with the HTML and Javascript that control the user interface.  To protect this bridge on Android, the 
framework uses a BridgeSecret to protect it from third-party hijacking.  However, the BridgeSecret is not sufficiently random and can be determined in certain scenarios.

Upgreade Path:
Developers who are concerned about this issue should rebuild their applications with Cordova Android 4.1.1 or later.  Versions after 3.6.4 do not contain this vulnerability.
