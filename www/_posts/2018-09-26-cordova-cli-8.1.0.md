We are happy to announce that Cordova CLI `8.1.0` was released in September 2018.

## Deprecation Note

As NodeJS 4.x support ended on April 30<sup>th</sup>, 2018, we are proceeding with our [previously announced](http://cordova.apache.org/news/2016/10/01/0.x-4.x-deprecation-timeline.html) deprecation timeline.  This is probably the last release that will support NodeJS 4.x.
