## Deprecation of the Cordova WKWebView Engine Plugin

We are hereby annoucing the deprecation of [cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine/blob/master/README.md#deprecation-notice).

This means that the Cordova development community will not be doing any more work on this plugin. You can continue to use this plugin as-is in existing and new applications running `cordova-ios@5.1.1` or earlier but any further issues will not be fixed by the Cordova team.

The WKWebView implementation has been moved to the core iOS platform as of `cordova-ios@6`. We encourage everyone to update to `cordova-ios@6` and to remove `cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine`.

Your feedback is graciously accepted and appreciated!
