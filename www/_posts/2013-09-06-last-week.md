Last week Cordova saw 39 commits come in, `plugman` reached version `0.11.0`, and `CLI` reached `3.0.9`.

`plugman` now has initial support for Windows Phone, plugin URLs can now
[specify a git hash and subdirectory](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4622),
and `<engine>` tags [are now enforced](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4494).
There was also good progress made towards launching our [Plugin Registry](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4489).

*Other Notable Changes:*

- `<lib-file>` [can now be used](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4430) by plugins to add `.jar` files on Android.
- `cordova plugin rm` now doesn't choke when a file is already deleted
- `cordova platform ls` now shows both installed and [available-to-install](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-3904) platforms
- `cordova-plugin-camera` data-URIs [now work again on Android](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4656)
- `cordova-plugin-device-orientation` [got BB10 support](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-3687)
- `cordova-plugin-file`'s DirectoryEntry.copy() [is now recursive](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4514).
- `cordova-plugin-geolocation` got Win8 support
- `cordova-plugin-vibrate` [added a missing permission](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4661) for Android.
