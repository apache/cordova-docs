We are happy to announce that `cordova-common@4.1.0`. This is one of the libraries used behind-the-scenes by nearly all of the Cordova tooling and provides utilities for dealing with things like `config.xml` parsing.

## Release Highlights

The most notable improvement in this minor release is the ability to pass nearly all XML DOM element attributes to the platform's JS tooling. By passing down all attribute data, Cordova-Common no longer needs to be updated for adding and supporting new platform attributes.

Please report any issues you find at [issues.cordova.io](http://issues.cordova.io/)!
