We are happy to announce that `Cordova Android 4.0.0` has been released!

This release adds significant functionality, and also introduces a number
of breaking changes. Mostly though, it adds first-class support for [Crosswalk](https://crosswalk-project.org/) -- a bundled modern WebView!

`cordova-android@4.0.0` will be the default android version in the next
version of `cordova`. If you just can't wait though, you can try it out now:

    cd my_project
    cordova platform update android@4.0.0
    cordova plugin add https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-whitelist.git#r1.0.0
    # To install Crosswalk (optional):
    cordova plugin add https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview.git#1.0.0

<!--more-->

## Major Changes
* Support for pluggable WebViews!
    * [Crosswalk](https://crosswalk-project.org/) can be added by installing the [cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/cordova-crosswalk-engine) plugin.
* Splash screen functionality is now provided via plugin
  * You will need to add the new [cordova-plugin-splashscreen](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-splashscreen) plugin to continue using a splash screen
* Whitelist functionality is revamped
  * You will need to add the new [cordova-plugin-whitelist](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-whitelist) plugin to continue using a whitelist
  * Setting a Content-Security-Policy (CSP) is now supported and is the recommended way to whitelist (see details in plugin readme)
  * Network requests are *blocked* by default without the plugin, so install this plugin even to allow all requests, and even if you are using CSP.
  * This new whitelist is enhanced to be more secure and configurable, but the Legacy whitelist behaviour is still available via a separate plugin (not recommended).
  * Note: while not strictly part of this release, the latest default app created by cordova-cli will include this plugin by default.

## Changes For Plugin Developers:

* Develop in Android Studio
  * Android Studio is now fully supported, and recommended over Eclipse
  * Use `cordova plugin add ../path/to/my-plugin --link` to symlink .java files for development
* Build using Gradle
  * All builds [use Gradle by default](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/guide_platforms_android_tools.md.html#Android%20Shell%20Tool%20Guide_building_with_gradle), instead of Ant
  * Plugins can add their own gradle build steps!
  * Plugins can depend on Maven libraries using `<framework>` tags
* New APIs: `onStart`, `onStop`, `onConfigurationChanged`
* `"onScrollChanged"` message removed. Use `view.getViewTreeObserver().addOnScrollChangedListener(...)` instead
* [CB-8702](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-8702) New API for plugins to override `shouldInterceptRequest` with a stream
