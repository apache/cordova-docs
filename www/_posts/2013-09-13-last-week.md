Last week Cordova saw 83 commits come in from 24 different authors. No releases were made,
but attention was spent on [adding Firefox OS support](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CB%20AND%20component%20%3D%20FirefoxOS),
translating docs, and fixing bugs.

*Other Notable Changes:*

- FileTransfer on wp7 now supports basic authentication
- BlackBerry [no longer validates buildId](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4732) and [--no-build works again](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4785)
- `cordova serve` now serves all platforms at the same time (via /android/www, /ios/www, etc)
- `cordova plugin ls` now takes ~50ms instead of ~700ms to run
- Plugin URLs [are now optional](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4770) within `<dependency>` tags. The registry will be used when only an ID is given.
