We are happy to announce that `Cordova Windows 3.8.0` has been released!

This release adds support for new Visual Studio 2015 Tools and has various other improvements. It will be the default Windows version when the cordova-cli 4.3.0 is released.

To upgrade:

    npm install -g cordova
    cd my_project
    cordova platform update windows

To add it explicitly:

    cordova platform add windows@3.8.0



For non-CLI projects or for pre-3.0 projects, refer to the [upgrade guides](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/guide_platforms_index.md.html).
