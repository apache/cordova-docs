title: BlackBerry 10 Configuration
---

# BlackBerry 10 Configuration

The `config.xml` file controls an app's basic settings that apply
across each application and CordovaWebView instance. This section
details preferences that only apply to BlackBerry 10 builds. See [The config.xml
File](config_ref_index.md.html#The%20config.xml%20File) for information on global configuration options.

- `ChildBrowser` (`disable` or the default `enable`): Disables child
  browser windows. By default, apps launch a secondary browser window
  to display resources accessed via `window.open()` or by specifying a
  `_blank` anchor target. Specify `disable` to override this default
  behavior.

        <preference name="ChildBrowser" value="disable"/>

- `PopupBlocker` (`enable` or the default `disable`): Enables the
  popup blocker, which prevents calls to `window.open()`. By default,
  popups display in a child browser window. Setting the preference to
  `enable` prevents it from displaying at all.

        <preference name="PopupBlocker" value="enable"/>

- `WebSecurity` (`disable` or the default `enable`): Set to `disable`
  to override web security settings, allowing access to remote content
  from unknown sources. This preference is intended as a development
  convenience only, so remove it before packaging the app for
  distribution.  For the released app, all URIs should be known and
  whitelisted using the `<access>` element, described in the Domain
  [Whitelist Guide](../../appdev/whitelist/index.html).

        <preference name="WebSecurity" value="disable"/>
