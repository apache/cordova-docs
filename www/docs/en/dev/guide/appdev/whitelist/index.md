# Whitelist Guide

Domain whitelisting is a security model that controls access to
external domains over which your application has no control. Cordova
provides a configurable security policy to define which external sites may be
accessed.  By default, new apps are configured to allow access to any site.
Before moving your application to production, you should formulate a whitelist
and allow access to specific network domains and subdomains.

For Android and iOS (as of their 4.0 releases), Cordova's security policy is extensible via a plugin
interface.  Your app should use the [cordova-plugin-whitelist][wlp], as it provides
better security and configurability than earlier versions of Cordova.  While
it is possible to implement your own whitelist plugin, it is not recommended
unless your app has very specific security policy needs.  See the
[cordova-plugin-whitelist][wlp] for details on usage and configuration.

For other platforms, Cordova adheres to the [W3C Widget Access][1] specification,
which relies on the `<access>` element within the app's `config.xml` file to
enable network access to specific domains. For projects that rely on
the CLI workflow described in [The Command-Line Interface](../../cli/index.html), this file is
located in the project's top-level directory. Otherwise for
platform-specific development paths, locations are listed in the
sections below. (See the various [Platform Guides](../../platforms/index.html) for more information
on each platform.)

The following examples demonstrate `<access>` whitelist syntax:

* Access to [google.com][2]:

        <access origin="http://google.com" />

* Access to the secure [google.com][3] (`https://`):

        <access origin="https://google.com" />

* Access to the subdomain [maps.google.com][4]:

        <access origin="http://maps.google.com" />

* Access to all the subdomains on [google.com][2], for example
  [mail.google.com][5] and [docs.google.com][6]:

        <access origin="http://*.google.com" />

* Access to _all_ domains, for example, [google.com][2] and
  [developer.mozilla.org][7]:

        <access origin="*" />

  This is the default value for newly created CLI projects.

Be aware that some websites may automatically redirect from their home page to
a different url, such as using https protocol or to a country-specific
domain. For example http://www.google.com will redirect to use SSL/TLS at
https://www.google.com, and then may further redirect to a geography such as
https://www.google.co.uk. Such scenarios may require modified or additional
whitelist entries beyond your initial requirement. Please consider this
as you are building your whitelist.

Note that the whitelist applies only to the main Cordova webview, and does not
apply to an InAppBrowser webview or opening links in the system web browser.

## Amazon Fire OS Whitelisting

Platform-specific whitelisting rules are found in
`res/xml/config.xml`.

## Android Whitelisting

As above, see [cordova-plugin-whitelist][wlp] for details.  For cordova-android
prior to 4.0.0, see older versions of this documentation.

## iOS Whitelisting

As above, see [cordova-plugin-whitelist][wlp] for details.  For cordova-ios
prior to 4.0.0, see older versions of this documentation.

[Application Transport Security (ATS)](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW33) is new in iOS 9 (Xcode 7). This new feature acts as a whitelist for your app. The cli will automatically convert &lt;access&gt; and &lt;allow-navigation&gt; tags to the appropriate ATS directives.

The two tags mentioned above support these two new attributes below, which have their equivalents in ATS:

    1. minimum-tls-version (String, defaults to 'TLSv1.2')
	2. requires-forward-secrecy (Boolean, defaults to 'true')

See the [ATS Technote](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW33) for details.


## BlackBerry 10 Whitelisting

The whitelisting rules are found in `www/config.xml`.

BlackBerry 10's use of wildcards differs from other platforms in two
ways:

* Any content accessed by `XMLHttpRequest` must be declared
  explicitly. Setting `origin="*"` does not work in this case.
  Alternatively, all web security may be disabled using the
  `WebSecurity` preference described in BlackBerry Configuration:

        <preference name="websecurity" value="disable" />

* As an alternative to setting `*.domain`, set an additional
  `subdomains` attribute to `true`. It should be set to `false` by
  default. For example, the following allows access to `google.com`,
  `maps.google.com`, and `docs.google.com`:

        <access origin="http://google.com" subdomains="true" />

  The following narrows access to `google.com`:

        <access origin="http://google.com" subdomains="false" />

  Specify access to all domains, including the local `file://`
  protocol:

        <access origin="*" subdomains="true" />

(For more information on support, see BlackBerry's documentation on the
[access element][8].)

## Firefox OS

In Firefox OS there is no concept of whitelisting a specific domain. Instead
there is a special permission called
[SystemXHR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#Permissions).
There is a need to add this permission to `config.xml`:

	<platform name="firefoxos">
		<permission name="systemXHR" privileged="true" description="load data from server" />
	</platform>

The `XMLHttpRequest` object needs to be instantiated with two parameters
`mozAnon` and `mozSystem`:

	var request = new XMLHttpRequest({
		mozAnon: true,
		mozSystem: true});

This solution is transparent so there is no difference for other platforms.

## Windows Phone Whitelisting

The whitelisting rules for Windows Phone 8 are found in the
app's `config.xml` file.
