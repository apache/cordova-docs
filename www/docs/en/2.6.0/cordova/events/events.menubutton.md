title: menubutton
---

menubutton
===========

This is an event that fires when the user presses the menu button.

    document.addEventListener("menubutton", yourCallbackFunction, false);

Details
-------

If you need to override the default menu button behaviour you can register an event listener for the 'menubutton' event.

Typically, you will want to attach an event listener with `document.addEventListener` once you receive the Cordova '[deviceready](events.deviceready.html)' event.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- Android
- BlackBerry WebWorks (OS 5.0 and higher)

Quick [Example](../storage/storage.opendatabase.html)
-------------

    document.addEventListener("menubutton", onMenuKeyDown, false);

    function onMenuKeyDown() {
        // Handle the back button
    }
