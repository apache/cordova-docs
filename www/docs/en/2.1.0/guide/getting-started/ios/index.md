Getting Started with iOS
========================

This guide describes how to set up your development environment for Apache Cordova and run a sample Apache Cordova application.

Requirements
------------
- Xcode 4.3+
- Xcode Command Line Tools 
- Intel-based computer with Mac OS X Lion or greater (10.7+)
- Necessary for installing on device:
    - Apple iOS device (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch)
    - iOS developer certificate

Install the iOS SDK and Apache Cordova
----------------------------------

- Install **Xcode** from the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) or [Apple Developer Downloads](http://developer.apple.com/downloads)
- Install the **Xcode Command Line Tools** (**Xcode Preferences -> Downloads -> Components -> Command Line Tools -> Install**).
- Download the latest release of [Apache Cordova](http://phonegap.com/download)
    - extract its contents
    - Apache Cordova iOS is found under `lib/ios`


Install CordovaLib 
------------------

1. **Download** the Cordova source
2. **Extract** to source to their final permanent location on your hard drive (for example, to ~/Documents/CordovaLib-2.X.X)
3. There is no step 3

Create a New Project
--------------------

- Launch **Terminal.app**
- Drag the **bin** folder (located in the permanent folder location of Cordova, from the **"Install CordovaLib"** section above) to the **Terminal.app** icon in your Dock, it should launch a new Terminal window
- Type in `./create <project_folder_path> <package_name> <project_name>` then press **"Enter"**

        <project_folder_path> is the path to your new Cordova iOS project (it must be empty if it exists)
        <package_name> is the package name, following reverse-domain style convention
        <project_name> is the project name

- **Locate** your new project folder that you just created
- **Launch** the .xcodeproj file in the folder

    
Deploy to Simulator
-------------------

- Change the **Target** in the **Scheme** drop-down menu on the toolbar to **"HelloWorld"** (your project name)
- Change the **Active SDK** in the **Scheme** drop-down menu on the toolbar to **iOS [version] Simulator**

    ![](img/guide/platforms/ios/active_scheme_simulator.png)

- Select the **Run** button in your project window's toolbar

Deploy to Device
----------------

- Open `HelloWorld-Info.plist`, under the **Resources** group
- Change **BundleIdentifier** to the identifier provided by Apple or your own bundle identifier
    - If you have a developer license, you can run the [Assistant](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/manage/overview/index.action) to register your app
- Change the **Target** in the **Scheme** drop-down menu on the toolbar to **"HelloWorld"** (your project name)
- Change the **Active SDK** in the Scheme drop-down menu on the toolbar to **[Your Device Name]**
    - You will need to have your device connected via USB

- Select the **Run** button in your project window's toolbar

Results
----------------
- You should see the screen below, with a pulsating green **"device is ready"** message

Problems in Xcode
----------------
If you have compilation problems related to missing headers, the build products should **build into the same build directory**. You may need to set the preference **"Xcode Preferences -> Locations -> Derived Data -> Advancedâ€¦"** to **"Unique"**. This is the default setting for Xcode on a fresh new install, if you upgraded from older versions of Xcode, you might have a legacy preference in there that you need to update.


Build Your App
--------------

You now have an Xcode project setup and you can build and run on the Simulator and device.
It is important to understand that you do not need to use Xcode to write your web application.
You can use your favourite text editor and simply rebuild your project using Xcode, or the [command-line tools](guide_command-line_index.md.html#Command-Line%20Usage) in your project folder (under the **cordova** sub-folder)
Xcode will automatically detect the files that are changed in `www`.

Problems in the Command Line Tools
----------------
If you see this error: **"Error: No developer directory found at /Developer. Run /usr/bin/xcode-select to update the developer directory path."** Run this to set your Developer folder:

        sudo /usr/bin/xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
