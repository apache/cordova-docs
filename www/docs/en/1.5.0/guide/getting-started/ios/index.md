Getting Started with iOS
========================


Video Tutorials:
----------------

- [PhoneGap Installer - Xcode 4 Template](http://www.youtube.com/v/R9zktJUN7AI?autoplay=1)


1. Requirements
---------------
- Intel-based computer with Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6)
- Necessary for Installing on <a href="../../../phonegap/device/device.html">Device</a>:
    - An Apple iOS device (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch)
    - iOS developer certification


2. Install SDK + PhoneGap
-------------------------

- Download and install Xcode from [Apple Developer Portal](http://developer.apple.com) (Membership required)</p>
- Download the latest copy of [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/download) and extract its contents. We will be working with the Android directory.


3. Setup New Project
--------------------

- Launch Xcode, then under the <a href="../../../phonegap/file/fileobj/fileobj.html">File</a> menu select **New** and then **New Project...**
- Select **PhoneGap-based Application** from the list of templates

- Select the **Next** button, Fill in the "Product Name" &amp; "Company Identifier" for your app

    ![](img/guide/platforms/ios/xcode4-<a href="../../../phonegap/storage/parameters/name.html">name</a>_your_app.png)
    
- Choose a directory to store your app
- You should see your project in Xcode 4 now. Press the **Run** button in the top left corner. Your build should succeed and launch in the simulator
- You should see a error in your simulator informing you index.html was not found
- To fix this, we need to copy the **www** directory into the project. Right click on the project in the left navigation window and click show in finder
- In Finder, you should see the **www** directory beside your project
- Next step is **IMPORTANT**! Drag the **www** folder into Xcode 4. You can't just drag the www folder into your app's folder. It needs to be dragged into Xcode 4!! In my case I would drag it and drop it on HiWorld shown below.

- After you drag, you should see a prompt with a few options. Make sure to select **Create folder references for any added folders**. Click Finish


4. <a href="../webos/index.html">Hello World</a>
--------------

Open the folder <a href="../../../phonegap/storage/parameters/name.html">name</a>d **www** and type `<h1><a href="../webos/index.html">Hello World</a></h1>` after the `<body>` tag in **index.html**. You can also add any associated Javascript and CSS files there as well.
    
    
5A. Deploy to Simulator
-----------------------

- Make sure to change the Active SDK in the top left menu to **Simulator+<a href="../../../phonegap/storage/parameters/version.html">version</a>#**.
- Hit **Run** in your project window header.


5B. Deploy to <a href="../../../phonegap/device/device.html">Device</a>
--------------------

- Open [AppName]-Info.plist and change **BundleIdentifier** to the identifier provided by Apple. If you have a developer license, you can access and run the Assistant at [here](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/manage/overview/index.action) and register your App.
- Make sure to change the Active SDK in the top left menu to **<a href="../../../phonegap/device/device.html">Device</a>+<a href="../../../phonegap/storage/parameters/version.html">version</a>#**.
- Hit **Run** in your project window header.
