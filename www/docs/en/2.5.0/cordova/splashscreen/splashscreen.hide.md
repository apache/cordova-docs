iOS Quirk

1. In your **config.xml**, you need to [modify the value](guide_project-settings_index.md.html#Project%20Settings) for **"AutoHideSplashScreen‚Äù** to false

2. Then, if you want to delay hiding the splash screen for 2 seconds, you can do this in your **deviceready** event handler:

        setTimeout(function() {
            navigator.splashscreen.hide();
        }, 2000);
