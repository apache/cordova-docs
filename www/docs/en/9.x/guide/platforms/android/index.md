# Android Platform Guide

This guide shows how to set up your SDK environment to deploy Cordova
apps for Android devices, and how to optionally use Android-centered
command-line tools in your development workflow.  You need to install
the Android SDK regardless of whether you want to use these
platform-centered shell tools or cross-platform Cordova CLI for
development. For a comparison of the two development paths, see the
[Overview](../../overview/index.html#development-paths). For details on
the CLI, see [Cordova CLI Reference][cli_reference].

## Requirements and Support

Cordova for Android requires the Android SDK which can be installed
on OS X, Linux or Windows. See the Android SDK's
[System Requirements](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Requirements).
Cordova's latest Android package supports up to Android [API Level](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#ApiLevels) 27.
The supported Android API Levels and Android Versions for the past
few cordova-android releases can be found in this table:

cordova-android Version | Supported Android API-Levels | Equivalent Android Version
------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------
7.X.X                   | 19 - 27                      | 4.4 - 8.1
6.X.X                   | 16 - 26                      | 4.1 - 8.0.0
5.X.X                   | 14 - 23                      | 4.0 - 6.0.1
4.1.X                   | 14 - 22                      | 4.0 - 5.1
4.0.X                   | 10 - 22                      | 2.3.3 - 5.1
3.7.X                   | 10 - 21                      | 2.3.3 - 5.0.2

Please note that the versions listed here are for Cordova's Android package,
[cordova-android](https://github.com/apache/cordova-android), and not for the
Cordova CLI. To determine what version of Cordova's Android package is installed
in your Cordova project, run the command `cordova platform ls` in the directory
that holds your project.

As a general rule, Android versions become unsupported by Cordova as
they dip below 5% on Google's
[distribution dashboard](http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html).

## Installing the Requirements

### Java Development Kit (JDK)

Install [Java Development Kit (JDK) 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

When installing on Windows you also need to set `JAVA_HOME` Environment Variable
according to your JDK installation path (see [Setting Environment Variables](#setting-environment-variables))

### Gradle

As of Cordova-Android 6.4.0, [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) is now required to be installed to build Android.

When installing on Windows, you need to add Gradle to your path, (see [Setting Environment Variables](#setting-environment-variables))

### Android SDK

Install [Android Studio][android_studio]. Follow the instructions at the linked Android Developer site to get started.
Opening Android Studio for the first time will guide you through the process of installing the Android SDK.

#### Adding SDK Packages

After installing the Android SDK, you must also install the packages for
whatever [API level](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#ApiLevels)
you wish to target. It is recommended that you install the highest SDK version
that your version of cordova-android supports (see [Requirements and Support](#requirements-and-support)).

Open the Android SDK Manager (`Tools > SDK Manager` in Android Studio, or `sdkmanager` on the command line),
and make sure the following are installed:

1. Android Platform SDK for your targeted version of Android
1. Android SDK build-tools version 19.1.0 or higher
1. Android Support Repository (found under the "SDK Tools" tab)

See Android's documentation on [Installing SDK Packages](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update)
for more details.

### Setting environment variables

Cordova's CLI tools require some environment variables to be set in order to
function correctly. The CLI will attempt to set these variables for you, but
in certain cases you may need to set them manually. The following variables
should be updated:

1. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the location of your JDK
   installation
2. Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the location of your Android
   SDK installation
3. It is also recommended that you add the Android SDK's `tools`, `tools/bin`,
   and `platform-tools` directories to your `PATH`

#### OS X and Linux

On a Mac or Linux, you can use a text editor to create or modify the
`~/.bash_profile` file. To set an environment variable, add a line that uses
`export` like so (substitute the path with your local installation):

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/Development/android-sdk/
```

To update your `PATH`, add a line resembling the following (substitute the paths
with your local Android SDK installation's location):

```bash
export PATH=${PATH}:/Development/android-sdk/platform-tools:/Development/android-sdk/tools
```

Reload your terminal to see this change reflected or run the following command:

```bash
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

#### Windows

These steps may vary depending on your installed version of Windows. Close and
reopen any command prompt windows after making changes to see them reflected.

1. Click on the __Start__ menu in the lower-left corner of the desktop

1. In the search bar, search for __Environment Variables__ and select __Edit the
   system Environment Variables__ from the options that appear

1. In the window that appears, click the __Environment Variables__ button

##### To create a new environment variable:

1. Click __New...__ and enter the variable name and value

##### To set your __PATH__:

1. Select the __PATH__ variable and press __Edit__.

1. Add entries for the relevant locations to the __PATH__. For example
(substitute the paths with your local Android SDK installation's location):

    ```
    C:\Users\[your user]\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools
    C:\Users\[your user]\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\tools
    ```

## Project Configuration

### Setting up an Emulator

If you wish to run your Cordova app on an Android emulator, you will first need
to create an Android Virtual Device (AVD). See the Android documentation for
[managing AVDs](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html),
[configuring the emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator.html#about),
and [setting up hardware acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration.html).

Once your AVD is configured correctly, you should be able to deploy your Cordova
application to the emulator by running:

```bash
$ cordova run --emulator
```

### Configuring Gradle

As of **cordova-android@4.0.0**, Cordova for Android projects are built using
[Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/). For instructions on building with Ant, refer
to older versions of the documentation. Please note that Ant builds are
deprecated as of the Android SDK Tools 25.3.0.

#### Setting Gradle Properties

It is possible to configure the Gradle build by setting the values of certain
[Gradle properties](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html)
that Cordova exposes. The following properties are available to be set:

| Property                          | Description
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
| `cdvBuildMultipleApks`            | If this is set, then multiple APK files will be generated: One per native platform supported by library projects (x86, ARM, etc). This can be important if your project uses large native libraries, which can drastically increase the size of the generated APK. If not set, then a single APK will be generated which can be used on all devices
| `cdvVersionCode`                  | Overrides the versionCode set in `AndroidManifest.xml`
| `cdvReleaseSigningPropertiesFile` | *Default: `release-signing.properties`*<br>Path to a .properties file that contains signing information for release builds (see [Signing an App](#signing-an-app))
| `cdvDebugSigningPropertiesFile`   | *Default: `debug-signing.properties`*<br>Path to a .properties file that contains signing information for debug builds (see [Signing an App](#signing-an-app)). Useful when you need to share a signing key with other developers
| `cdvMinSdkVersion`                | Overrides the value of `minSdkVersion` set in `AndroidManifest.xml`. Useful when creating multiple APKs based on SDK version
| `cdvBuildToolsVersion`            | Overrides the automatically detected `android.buildToolsVersion` value
| `cdvCompileSdkVersion`            | Overrides the automatically detected `android.compileSdkVersion` value

You can set these properties in one of four ways:

  1. By setting environment variables like so:

      ```bash
      $ export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_cdvMinSdkVersion=20
      $ cordova build android
      ```

  2. By using the `--gradleArg` flag in your Cordova `build` or `run` commands:

      ```bash
      $ cordova run android -- --gradleArg=-PcdvMinSdkVersion=20
      ```

  3. By placing a file called `gradle.properties` in your Android platform
      folder (`<your-project>/platforms/android`) and setting the properties in it
      like so:

      ```
      # In <your-project>/platforms/android/app/gradle.properties
      cdvMinSdkVersion=20
      ```

  4. By extending `build.gradle` via a [`build-extras.gradle` file](#extending-buildgradle)
    and setting the property like so:

      ```groovy
      // In <your-project>/platforms/android/app/build-extras.gradle
      ext.cdvMinSdkVersion = 20
      ```

The latter two options both involve including an extra file in your Android
platform folder. In general, it is discouraged that you edit the contents of
this folder because it is easy for those changes to be lost or overwritten.
Instead, these two files should be copied from another location into that folder
as part of the build command by using the `before_build`
[hook](../../appdev/hooks/index.html).

#### Extending build.gradle

If you need to customize `build.gradle`, rather than edit it directly, you
should create a sibling file named `build-extras.gradle`. This file will be
included by the main `build.gradle` when present. This file must be placed in
the `app` folder of the Android platform directory (`<your-project>/platforms/android/app`), 
so it is recommended that you copy it over via a script attached to the 
`before_build` [hook](../../appdev/hooks/index.html).

Here's an example:

```groovy
// Example build-extras.gradle
// This file is included at the beginning of `build.gradle`

// special properties (see `build.gradle`) can be set and overwrite the defaults
ext.cdvDebugSigningPropertiesFile = '../../android-debug-keys.properties'

// normal `build.gradle` configuration can happen
android {
  defaultConfig {
    testInstrumentationRunner 'android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner'
  }
}
dependencies {
  androidTestImplementation 'com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:2.2.2', {
    exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'support-annotations'
  }
}

// When set, this function `ext.postBuildExtras` allows code to run at the end of `build.gradle`
ext.postBuildExtras = {
    android.buildTypes.debug.applicationIdSuffix = '.debug'
}
```

Note that plugins can also include `build-extras.gradle` files via:

```xml
<framework src="some.gradle" custom="true" type="gradleReference" />
```

### Setting the Version Code

To change the [version code](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning.html)
for your app's generated apk, set the `android-versionCode` attribute in the widget
element of your application's [config.xml file](../../../config_ref/index.html).
If the `android-versionCode` is not set, the version code will be determined
using the `version` attribute. For example, if the version is `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

```
versionCode = MAJOR * 10000 + MINOR * 100 + PATCH
```

If your application has enabled the `cdvBuildMultipleApks` Gradle property (see
[Setting Gradle Properties](#setting-gradle-properties)), the version code of
your app will also be multiplied by 10 so that the last digit of the code can be
used to indicate the architecture the apk was built for. This multiplication
will happen regardless of whether the version code is taken from the
`android-versionCode` attribute or generated using the `version`. Be aware that
some plugins added to your project (including cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview)
may set this Gradle property automatically.

**Please Note:** When updating the `android-versionCode` property, it is unwise
to increment the version code taken from built apks. Instead, you should
increment the code based off the value in your `config.xml` file's
`android-versionCode` attribute. This is because the `cdvBuildMultipleApks`
property causes the version code to be multiplied by 10 in the built apks and
thus using that value will cause your next version code to be 100 times the
original, etc.

## Signing an App

First, you should read the [Android app signing requirements](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html).

### Using Flags

To sign an app, you need the following parameters:

| Parameter             | Flag              | Description
|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------
| Keystore              | `--keystore`      | Path to a binary file which can hold a set of keys
| Keystore Password     | `--storePassword` | Password to the keystore
| Alias                 | `--alias`         | The id specifying the private key used for signing
| Password              | `--password`      | Password for the private key specified
| Type of the Keystore  | `--keystoreType`  | *Default: auto-detect based on file extension*<br>Either pkcs12 or jks

These parameters can be specified using the command line arguments above to
the [Cordova CLI][cli_reference] `build` or `run` commands.

__Note__: You should use double `--` to indicate that these are platform-specific arguments, for example:

`cordova run android --release -- --keystore=../my-release-key.keystore --storePassword=password --alias=alias_name --password=password`.

### Using build.json

Alternatively, you could specify them in a build configuration file (`build.json`)
using the `--buildConfig` argument to the same commands. Here's a sample of a
build configuration file:

```json
{
    "android": {
        "debug": {
            "keystore": "../android.keystore",
            "storePassword": "android",
            "alias": "mykey1",
            "password" : "password",
            "keystoreType": ""
        },
        "release": {
            "keystore": "../android.keystore",
            "storePassword": "",
            "alias": "mykey2",
            "password" : "password",
            "keystoreType": ""
        }
    }
}
```

For release signing, passwords can be excluded and the build system will issue a
prompt asking for the password.

There is also support to mix and match command line arguments and parameters in
`build.json`. Values from the command line arguments will get precedence.
This can be useful for specifying passwords on the command line.

### Using Gradle

You can also specify signing properties by including a `.properties` file and
pointing to it with the `cdvReleaseSigningPropertiesFile` and
`cdvDebugSigningPropertiesFile` Gradle properties (see [Setting Gradle Properties](#setting-gradle-properties)).
The file should look like this:

```
storeFile=relative/path/to/keystore.p12
storePassword=SECRET1
storeType=pkcs12
keyAlias=DebugSigningKey
keyPassword=SECRET2
```

`storePassword` and `keyPassword` are optional, and will be prompted for if omitted.

## Debugging

For details on the debugging tools that come packaged with the Android SDK, see
[Android's developer documentation for debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/index.html).
Additionally, Android's developer documentation for [debugging web apps](http://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/debugging.html)
provides an introduction for debugging the portion of your app running in the
Webview.

### Opening a Project in Android Studio

Cordova for Android projects can be opened in the Android IDE,
[Android Studio][android_studio].
This can be useful if you wish to use Android Studio's built in Android
debugging/profiling tools or if you are developing Android plugins. Please note
that when opening your project in Android studio, it is recommended that you do
NOT edit your code in the IDE. This will edit the code in the `platforms` folder
of your project (not `www`), and changes are liable to be overwritten. Instead,
edit the `www` folder and copy over your changes by running `cordova build`.

Plugin developers wishing to edit their native code in the IDE should use the
`--link` flag when adding their plugin to the project via `cordova plugin add`.
This will link the files so that changes to the plugin files in the `platforms`
folder are reflected in your plugin's source folder (and vice versa).

To open a Cordova for Android project in Android Studio:

  1. Launch __Android Studio__.

  1. Select __Import Project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc)__.

      ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/guide/platforms/android/asdk_import_project.png)

  1. Select the Android platform directory in your project (`<your-project>/platforms/android`).

      ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/guide/platforms/android/asdk_import_select_location.png)

  1. For the `Gradle Sync` question you can simply answer __Yes__.

Once it finishes importing, you should be able to build and run the app directly
from __Android Studio__. See [Android Studio Overview](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/index.html)
and [Building and Running from Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/index.html)
for more details.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/img/guide/platforms/android/asdk_import_done.png)

## Platform Centered Workflow

cordova-android includes a number of scripts that allow the platform to be used
without the full Cordova CLI. This development path may offer you a greater
range of development options in certain situations than the cross-platform
cordova CLI. For example, you need to use shell tools when deploying a custom
Cordova WebView alongside native components. Before using this development path,
you must still configure the Android SDK environment as described in
[Requirements and Support](#requirements-and-support) above.

For each of the scripts discussed below, refer to [Cordova CLI Reference][cli_reference]
for more information on their arguments and usage. Each script has a name that
matches the corresponding CLI command. For example, `cordova-android/bin/create`
is equivalent to `cordova create`.

To get started, either download the cordova-android package from
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-android) or
[Github](https://github.com/apache/cordova-android).

To create a project using this package, run the `create` script in the `bin`
folder:

```bash
$ cordova-android/bin/create
```

The created project will have a folder named `cordova` inside that contains
scripts for the project-specific Cordova commands (e.g. `run`, `build`, etc.).
Additionally, the project will feature a structure different from that of a
normal Cordova project. Notably, `/www` is moved to `/assets/www`.

To install plugins in this project, use the [Cordova Plugman Utility](../../../plugin_ref/plugman.html).


## Upgrading

Refer to [this](./upgrade.html) article for instructions to upgrade your
`cordova-android` version.

## Lifecycle Guide

### Cordova and Android

Native Android apps typically consist of a series of [activities](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html) that the user
interacts with. Activities can be thought of as the individual screens that make
up an application; different tasks in an app will often have their own activity.
Each activity has its own lifecycle that is maintained as the activity enters
and leaves the foreground of a user's device.

In contrast, Cordova applications on the Android platform are executed within a
Webview that is embedded in a *single* Android activity. The lifecycle of this
activity is exposed to your application through the document events that are
fired. The events are not guaranteed to line up with Android's lifecycle, but
they can provide guidelines for saving and restoring your state. These events
roughly map to Android callbacks as follows:

Cordova Event   | Rough Android Equivalent  | Meaning
----------------|---------------------------|-----------------
`deviceready`   | `onCreate()`              | Application is starting (not from background)
`pause`         | `onPause()`               | Application is moving to the background
`resume`        | `onResume()`              | Application is returning to the foreground

Most other Cordova platforms have a similar concept of lifecycles and should
fire these same events when similar actions happen on a user's device. However,
Android presents some unique challenges that can sometimes show up thanks to the
native Activity lifecycle.

### What makes Android different?

In Android, the OS can choose to kill activities in the background in order to
free up resources if the device is low on memory. Unfortunately, when the
activity holding your application is killed, the Webview in which your
application lives will be destroyed as well. Any state that your application is
maintaining will be lost in this case. When the user navigates back to your
application, the Activity and Webview will be recreated by the OS, but state
will not be automatically restored for your Cordova app. For this reason, it is
imperative that your application be aware of the lifecycle events that are fired
and maintain whatever state is appropriate to make sure a user's context in your
app is not lost when they leave the application.

### When can this happen?

Your application is susceptible to being destroyed by the OS whenever it leaves
the sight of the user. There are two main situations in which this can occur.
The first and most obvious case is when the user presses the home button or
switches to another application.

However, there is a second (and much more subtle) case that certain plugins can
introduce. As noted above, Cordova applications are usually confined to the
single activity that contains the Webview. However, there are instances in which
other activities may be launched by plugins and temporarily push the Cordova
activity to the background. These other Activities are typically launched in
order to perform a specific task using a native application installed on the
device. For example, the [Cordova camera plugin](../../../reference/cordova-plugin-camera/index.html)
launches whatever camera activity is natively installed on the device in order
to take a photo. Reusing the installed camera application in this way makes your
application feel much more like a native app when the user tries to take a
photo. Unfortunately, when the native Activity pushes your app to the background
there is a chance the OS will kill it.

For a clearer understanding of this second case, let's walk through an example
using the camera plugin. Imagine you have an application that requires the user
to take a profile photo. The flow of events in the application when everything
goes as planned will look something like this:

1. The user is interacting with your app and needs to take a picture
2. The camera plugin launches the native camera activity
    * *The Cordova activity is pushed to the background (pause event is fired)*
3. The user takes a photo
4. The camera activity finishes
    * *The Cordova activity is moved to the foreground (resume event is fired)*
5. The user is returned to your application where they left off

However, this flow of events can be disrupted if a device is low on memory. If
the Activity is killed by the OS, the above sequence of events instead plays out
as follows:

1. The user is interacting with your app and needs to take a picture
2. The camera plugin launches the native camera activity
    * *The OS destroys the Cordova activity (pause event is fired)*
3. The user takes a photo
4. The camera activity finishes
    * *The OS recreates the Cordova activity (deviceready and resume events are fired)*
5. The user is confused as to why they are suddenly back at your app's login screen

In this instance, the OS killed the application in the background and the
application did not maintain its state as part of the lifecycle. When the user
returned to the app, the Webview was recreated and the app appeared to have
restarted from scratch (hence the user's confusion). This sequence of events is
equivalent to what happens when the home button is pressed or the user switches
applications. The key to preventing the above experience is subscribing to
events and properly maintaining state as part of the activity lifecycle.

### Respecting the Lifecycle

In the examples above, the javascript events that are fired are noted in
italics. These events are your opportunity to save and restore your
application's state. You should register callbacks in your application's
`bindEvents` function that respond to the lifecycle events by saving state. What
information you save and how you save it is left to your discretion, but you
should be sure to save enough information so that you can restore the user to
exactly where they left off when they return to your application.

There is one additional factor in the example above that only applies in the
second-discussed situation (i.e. when a plugin launches an external activity).
Not only was the state of the application lost when the user finished taking a
photo, but so was the photo that the user took. Normally, that photo would be
delivered to your application through the callback that was registered with the
camera plugin. However, when the Webview was destroyed that callback was lost
forever. Luckily, cordova-android 5.1.0 and above provide a means for getting
the result of that plugin call when your application resumes.

### Retrieving plugin callback results (cordova-android 5.1.0+)

When the OS destroys the Cordova activity that was pushed into the background
by a plugin, any pending callbacks are lost as well. This means that if you
passed a callback to the plugin that launched the new activity (e.g. the camera
plugin), that callback will NOT be fired when the application is recreated.
However, starting in cordova-android **5.1.0**, the `resume` event's payload will
contain any pending plugin results from the plugin request that launched the
external activity made prior to the activity being destroyed.

The payload for the `resume` event adheres to the following format:

```text
{
    action: "resume",
    pendingResult: {
        pluginServiceName: string,
        pluginStatus: string,
        result: any
    }
}
```

The fields of that payload are defined as follows:

* `pluginServiceName`: The name of the plugin returning the result (e.g. "Camera"). This can be found in the `<name>` tag of a plugin's plugin.xml file
* `pluginStatus`: The status of the plugin call (see below)
* `result`: Whatever the result of the plugin call is

The possible values for `pluginStatus` in the `pendingResult` field include the following:
* `"OK"` - The plugin call was successful
* `"No Result"` - The plugin call ended with no result
* `"Error"` - The plugin call resulted in some general error
* Other miscellaneous errors
    * `"Class not found"`
    * `"Illegal access"`
    * `"Instantiation error"`
    * `"Malformed url"`
    * `"IO error"`
    * `"Invalid action"`
    * `"JSON error"`

Please note that it is up to the plugin to decide what is contained in the
`result` field and the meaning of the `pluginStatus` that is returned. Reference
the API of the plugin you are using to see what you should expect those fields
to contain and how to use their values.

#### Example

Below is a brief example application that uses the `resume` and `pause` events
to manage state. It uses the Apache camera plugin as an example of how to
retrieve the results of a plugin call from the `resume` event payload. The
portion of the code dealing with the `resume`'s `event.pendingResult` object

### Testing the Activity Lifecycle

Android provides a developer setting for testing Activity destruction on low
memory. Enable the "Don't keep activities" setting in the Developer Options menu
on your device or emulator to simulate low memory scenarios. You should always
do some amount of testing with this setting enabled to make sure that your
application is properly maintaining state.
