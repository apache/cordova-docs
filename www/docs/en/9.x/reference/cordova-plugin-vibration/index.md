# cordova-plugin-vibration

This plugin aligns with the W3C vibration specification http://www.w3.org/TR/vibration/

This plugin provides a way to vibrate the device.

This plugin defines global objects including `navigator.vibrate`.

Although in the global scope, they are not available until after the `deviceready` event.
```javascript
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
function onDeviceReady() {
    console.log(navigator.vibrate);
}
```
## Installation
```console
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-vibration
```

## Supported Platforms

navigator.vibrate

- Android
- iOS
- Windows


The Android webview (API level 19 and up) supports the [W3C Vibration API](https://www.w3.org/TR/vibration/) natively and therefore, the Android specific implementation of this plugin has been dropped.

## vibrate

This function has three different functionalities based on parameters passed to it.

### Standard vibrate

Vibrates the device for a given amount of time.

```javascript
navigator.vibrate(time)
```
or
```javascript
navigator.vibrate([time])
```

-__time__: Milliseconds to vibrate the device. _(Number)_

#### Example
```javascript
// Vibrate for 3 seconds
navigator.vibrate(3000);

// Vibrate for 3 seconds
navigator.vibrate([3000]);
```
### Android Quirks

Calls to `navigator.vibrate` will immediately return `false` if user hasn't tapped on the frame or any embedded frame yet. Please checkout https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-14022 for more information.


#### iOS Quirks

- __time__: Ignores the specified time and vibrates for a pre-set amount of time.
```javascript
navigator.vibrate(3000); // 3000 is ignored
```
#### Windows Quirks

- __time__: Max time is 5000ms (5s) and min time is 1ms

```javascript
navigator.vibrate(8000); // will be truncated to 5000
```

### Vibrate with a pattern (Android and Windows only)
Vibrates the device with a given pattern
```javascript
navigator.vibrate(pattern);
```
- __pattern__: Sequence of durations (in milliseconds) for which to turn on or off the vibrator. _(Array of Numbers)_

#### Example

```javascript
// Vibrate for 1 second
// Wait for 1 second
// Vibrate for 3 seconds
// Wait for 1 second
// Vibrate for 5 seconds
navigator.vibrate([1000, 1000, 3000, 1000, 5000]);
```

### Cancel vibration (not supported in iOS)

Immediately cancels any currently running vibration.
```javascript
navigator.vibrate(0)
```
or
```javascript
navigator.vibrate([])
```
or
```javascript
navigator.vibrate([0])
```
Passing in a parameter of 0, an empty array, or an array with one element of value 0 will cancel any vibrations.
