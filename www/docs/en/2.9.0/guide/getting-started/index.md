Platform Guides
======================

Before developing for any of the platforms listed below, install
cordova's command-line interface (CLI).
(For details, see [The Cordova Command-line Interface](../cli/index.html).)

To develop Cordova applications, you must install SDKs for each mobile
platform you are targeting. This installation is necessary regardless
of whether you do the majority of your work in the SDK or use the CLI
for your build cycle.

This section tells you all you need to know to set up your development
environment to support each platform: where to obtain the SDK, how to
set up device emulators, how to connect devices for direct testing,
and managing signing key requirements.
