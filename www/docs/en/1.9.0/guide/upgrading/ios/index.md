Upgrading Cordova iOS
=====================

Please note that **Xcode 4 is required**. To submit to the Apple App Store, you must use the latest shipped version of the iOS SDK, which is iOS 5.1. The iOS 5.1 SDK requires Xcode 4.

## Upgrading Cordova 1.8.x projects to 1.9.0 ##

1. **Install** Cordova 1.9.0
2. **Create a new project** - you will have to grab assets from this new project
3. **Copy** the **www/cordova-1.9.0.js** file from the new project into your **www** folder, and delete your **www/cordova-1.8.x.js** file
4. **Update** the Cordova script reference in your **www/index.html** file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new **cordova-1.9.0.js** file

**Note:**

1.9.0 supports the new **"BackupWebStorage"** boolean setting in Cordova.plist. By default, this setting is turned on, set it to "false" to turn it off - especially for iOS 6 - see [Release Notes - Safari and UIKit Section](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/#releasenotes/General/RN-iOSSDK-6_0/_index.html)


## Upgrading Cordova 1.7.0 projects to 1.8.x ##

1. **Install** Cordova 1.8.0
2. **Create a new project** - you will have to grab assets from this new project
3. **Copy** the **www/cordova-1.8.0.js** file from the new project into your **www** folder, and delete your **www/cordova-1.7.x.js** file
4. **Update** the Cordova script reference in your **www/index.html** file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new **cordova-1.8.0.js** file

If you intend on using the **Capture API**, you will need the new **iPad retina-display** assets:

1.  **Copy** the **Resources/Capture.bundle** item from the new project into your project folder, over-writing your existing **Resources/Capture.bundle** item
2.  In your project, select the **Capture.bundle** item into Xcode into your Project Navigator, and press the **Delete** key, then select **Remove Reference** from the dialog that pops up.
3.  Drag the new **Capture.bundle** from Step 1. above into Xcode into your Project Navigator, and select the **Create groups for any added folders** radio-button

## Upgrading Cordova 1.6.x projects to 1.7.0 ##

1. **Install** Cordova 1.7.0
2. **Create a new project** - you will have to grab assets from this new project
3. **Copy** the **www/cordova-1.7.0.js** file from the new project into your **www** folder, and delete your **www/cordova-1.6.0.js** file
4. **Update** the Cordova script reference in your **www/index.html** file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new **cordova-1.7.0.js** file

## Upgrading Cordova 1.5.0 projects to 1.6.x ##

1. **Install** Cordova 1.6.1
2. **Make a backup** of **AppDelegate.m**, **AppDelegate.h**, **MainViewController.m**, **MainViewController.h**, and **Cordova.plist** in your project
3. **Create a new project** - you will have to grab assets from this new project
4. **Copy** these files from the **new** project into your 1.5.0 based project folder on disk, **replacing** any old files (**backup** your files first from step 2 above):

        AppDelegate.h
        AppDelegate.m
        MainViewController.h
        MainViewController.m
        Cordova.plist
5. **Add** all the new **MainViewController** and **AppDelegate** files into your Xcode project
6. **Copy** the **www/cordova-1.6.1.js** file from the new project into your **www** folder, and delete your **www/cordova-1.5.0.js** file
7. **Update** the Cordova script reference in your **www/index.html** file (and any other files that contain the script reference) to point to the new **cordova-1.6.1.js** file
8. **Add** the new **Cordova.plist** file into your project - this is because the core plugin service names needed to be changed to match the ones from Android and BlackBerry, for a unified Cordova JavaScript file (cordova-js). 
9. **Integrate** any settings, **Plugins** and **ExternalHosts** entries that you had in your **backed-up Cordova.plist** into the new **Cordova.plist**
10. **Integrate** any project specific code that you have in your **backed-up AppDelegate.h and AppDelegate.m** into the new AppDelegate files. Any **UIWebViewDelegate** or **CDVCommandDelegate** code in **AppDelegate.m** will need to go into MainViewController.m now (see commented out sections in that file)
11. **Integrate** any project specific code that you have in your **backed-up MainViewController.h and MainViewController.m** into the new MainViewController files
12. Click on the **project icon** in the Project Navigator, select your **Project**, then select the **"Build Settings"** tab
13. Enter **"Compiler for C/C++/Objective-C"** in the search field
14. Select the **"Apple LLVM Compiler 3.1"** value

        #import "CDVDeprecated.h"
19. Click on the **project icon** in the Project Navigator, select your **Target**, then select the **"Build Settings"** tab
20. Search for **"Framework Search Paths"**
21. Replace the existing value with **"/Users/Shared/Cordova/Frameworks"** 
22. Search for **"Preprocessor Macros"**
23. For the first (combined) value, replace the value with **"CORDOVA_FRAMEWORK=YES"**
24. Select the **"Build Phases"** tab
25. Expand **"Run Script"**
