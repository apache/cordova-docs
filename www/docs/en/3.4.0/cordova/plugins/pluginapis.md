# Plugin APIs

Cordova ships with a minimal set of APIs, and projects add what extra APIs they require through plugins.

You can search through all existing plugins using the [Plugin Registry](http://plugins.cordova.io/).

The traditional set of Cordova plugins are as follows:

- [Battery Status](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-battery-status/blob/master/README.md)
> Monitor the status of the device's battery.

- [Camera](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera/blob/master/README.md)
> Capture a photo using the device's camera.

- [Contacts](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-contacts/blob/master/README.md)
> Work with the devices contact database.

- [Device](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-device/blob/master/README.md)
> Gather device specific information.

- [Device Motion (Accelerometer)](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-device-motion/blob/master/README.md)
> Tap into the device's motion sensor.

- [Device Orientation (Compass)](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-device-orientation/blob/master/README.md)
> Obtain the direction that the device is pointing.

- [Dialogs](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-dialogs/blob/master/README.md)
> Visual device notifications.

> Make your application location aware.

> Enable representation of objects specific to a locale.

- [InAppBrowser](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/blob/master/README.md)
> Launch URLs in another in-app browser instance.
