Getting Started with Android
============================

This guide describes how to set up your development environment for Cordova and run a sample application.

1. Minimum Requirements for Development
---------------
- Identical to [Android Minimum Requirements](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

1.1 Supported Android <a href="../../../cordova/device/device.html">Device</a>s
-------------------------------
- Android 2.1 (Deprecated May 2013)
- Android 2.2
- Android 2.3
- Android 3.x (Deprecated May 2013)
- Android 4.x

We currently do not support Android 1.x, and we plan to deprecate platforms in the future as they are updated and dip below 5% on the [distribution dashboard](http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html) provided by Google.

2. Install SDK + Cordova
------------------------

- Download and install [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
- Download the latest copy of [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/#download) and extract its contents. We will be working with the Android directory.


3A. Setup your PATH environment variable on Mac OS
---------------------------------------

- Open the Terminal program (this is in your Applications/Utilites folder by default).
- Run the following command

`touch ~/.bash_profile; open ~/.bash_profile`

- This will open the file in the your default text editor.
- You need to add the path to your Android SDK platform-tools and tools directory. In my example I will use "/Development/android-sdk-macosx" as the directory the SDK is installed in. Add the following line:

`export PATH=${PATH}:/Development/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools:/Development/android-sdk-macosx/tools` 

- Save the file and quit the text editor.
- Execute your .bash_profile to update your PATH. 

`source ~/.bash_profile`

- Now everytime you open the Terminal program you PATH will included the Android SDK.

3B. Setup your PATH environment variable on Windows
---------------------------------------

- From the Desktop, right-click My Computer and click Properties.
- Click Advanced System Settings link in the left column.
- In the System Properties window click the Environment Variables button.
- Select the PATH variable from the System variables section.
- Select the Edit button.
- You need to add the path to your Android SDK platform-tools and tools directory. In my example I will use "C:\Development\android-sdk-windows" as the directory the SDK is installed in. Append the following text into the text box:

`;C:\Development\android-sdk-windows\platform-tools;C:\Development\android-sdk-windows\tools`

- Save your edit. Close the Environment Variables dialog.
- Additionally, you may need to include `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to your PATH as well. To check to see if this is required, run a command prompt and type `java`. If the program can not be found add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to the PATH. You may need to specify the full path instead of using the `%JAVA_HOME%` environment variable.
- Finally, you may need to include `%ANT_HOME%\bin` to your PATH as well. To check to see if this is required, run a command prompt and type `ant`. If the program can not be found add `%ANT_HOME%\bin` to the PATH. You may need to specify the full path instead of using the `%ANT_HOME%` environment variable.


4. Setup New Project
--------------------

- In a terminal window, navigate to the `bin` directory within the `android` subfolder of the Cordova distribution.
- Type in `./create <project_folder_path> <package_name> <project_name>` then press **"Enter"**

        <project_folder_path> is the path to your new Cordova Android project
        <package_name> is the package name, e.g. com.YourCompany.YourAppName
        <project_name> is the project name, e.g. YourApp (Must not contain spaces and dashes)
 
- If you're getting an 'An unexpected error occurred" error, try the command again prefixed with `sudo`

- Launch Eclipse, and select menu item **New Project**
    ![](img/guide/platforms/android/eclipse_new_project.png)
- Select the directory you used for `<project_folder_path>`
- Click Finish.

If your project has a red X indicating there is a problem follow these additional steps:

- Right click on the project folder.
- In the Properties dialog that is displayed select Android from the navigation pane.
- For the project build target select the highest Android API level you have installed.
- Click OK
- Then from the Project menu bar item select Clean.
- This should correct all the errors in the project.

5A. Deploy to Emulator
----------------------

- Right click the project and go to **Run As &gt; Android Application**
- Eclipse will ask you to select an appropriate AVD. If there isn't one, then you'll need to create it.

**Note: For a faster experience, use an Intel-based emulator image:**

- Open the Android SDK Manager
  ![](img/guide/platforms/android/eclipse_android_sdk_button.png)
- Install one or more `Intel x86 Atom` System Images as well as the `Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager` (under Extras).
- Run the Intel installer, which has been downloaded to: `extras/intel/Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager` within your Android SDK
- Create a new AVD with the Target set to an Intel image.
- When starting the emulator, ensure there are no error messages about the HAX module failing to load.


5B. Deploy to <a href="../../../cordova/device/device.html">Device</a>
--------------------

- Make sure USB debugging is enabled on your device and plug it into your system. Information can be found on the [Android Developer Site](http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html)
- Right click the project and go to **Run As &gt; Android Application**
