# cordova-plugin-battery-status


This plugin provides an implementation of an old version of the [Battery Status Events API](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-battery-status-20110915/).

It adds the following three `window` events:

* batterystatus
* batterycritical
* batterylow

## Installation

    cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-battery-status

## batterystatus

This event fires when the percentage of battery charge changes by at
least 1 percent, or if the device is plugged in or unplugged.

The battery status handler is passed an object that contains two
properties:

- __level__: The percentage of battery charge (0-100). _(Number)_

- __isPlugged__: A boolean that indicates whether the device is plugged in. _(Boolean)_

Applications typically should use `window.addEventListener` to
attach an event listener after the `deviceready` event fires.

### Supported Platforms

- Amazon Fire OS
- iOS
- Android
- BlackBerry 10
- Windows Phone 7 and 8
- Windows (Windows Phone 8.1 only)
- Tizen
- Firefox OS
- Browser

### Android and Amazon Fire OS Quirks

- Warning: the Android + Fire OS implementations are greedy and prolonged use will drain the user's battery. 

### Windows Phone 7 and 8 Quirks

Windows Phone 7 does not provide native APIs to determine battery
level, so the `level` property is unavailable.  The `isPlugged`
parameter _is_ supported.

### Windows Quirks

Windows Phone 8.1 does not support `isPlugged` parameter.
The `level` parameter _is_ supported.

### Browser Quirks

Supported browsers are Chrome, Firefox and Opera. 

### Example

    window.addEventListener("batterystatus", onBatteryStatus, false);

    function onBatteryStatus(info) {
        // Handle the online event
        console.log("Level: " + info.level + " isPlugged: " + info.isPlugged);
    }

## batterycritical

The event fires when the percentage of battery charge has reached the
critical battery threshold. The value is device-specific.

The `batterycritical` handler is passed an object that contains two
properties:

- __level__: The percentage of battery charge (0-100). _(Number)_

- __isPlugged__: A boolean that indicates whether the device is plugged in. _(Boolean)_

Applications typically should use `window.addEventListener` to attach
an event listener once the `deviceready` event fires.

### Supported Platforms

- Amazon Fire OS
- iOS
- Android
- BlackBerry 10
- Tizen
- Firefox OS
- Windows (Windows Phone 8.1 only)
- Browser

### Windows Quirks

Windows Phone 8.1 will fire `batterycritical` event regardless of plugged state as it is not supported.

### Example

    window.addEventListener("batterycritical", onBatteryCritical, false);

    function onBatteryCritical(info) {
        // Handle the battery critical event
        alert("Battery Level Critical " + info.level + "%\nRecharge Soon!");
    }

### Browser Quirks

Supported browsers are Chrome, Firefox and Opera. 

## batterylow

The event fires when the percentage of battery charge has reached the
low battery threshold, device-specific value.

The `batterylow` handler is passed an object that contains two
properties:

- __level__: The percentage of battery charge (0-100). _(Number)_

- __isPlugged__: A boolean that indicates whether the device is plugged in. _(Boolean)_

Applications typically should use `window.addEventListener` to
attach an event listener once the `deviceready` event fires.

### Supported Platforms

- Amazon Fire OS
- iOS
- Android
- BlackBerry 10
- Tizen
- Firefox OS
- Windows (Windows Phone 8.1 only)
- Browser

### Windows Quirks

Windows Phone 8.1 will fire `batterylow` event regardless of plugged state as it is not supported.

### Example

    window.addEventListener("batterylow", onBatteryLow, false);

    function onBatteryLow(info) {
        // Handle the battery low event
        alert("Battery Level Low " + info.level + "%");
    }

### Browser Quirks

Supported browsers are Chrome, Firefox and Opera.
