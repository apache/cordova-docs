# Windows Phone Shell Tool Guide

This guide <a href="../../../cordova/inappbrowser/inappbrowser.html">show</a>s how to use Cordova's set of platform-centered shell
tools to develop Windows Phone apps for both versions 7 and 8. This
development path, discussed in the <a href="../../overview/index.html">Overview</a>, may offer you a greater
range of development options for the Windows Phone platform than the
cross-platform CLI tool described in <a href="../../cli/index.html">The Command-Line Interface</a>.
Before using either development path, you must first configure the SDK
environment as described in the <a href="../wp7/index.html">Windows Phone 7 Platform Guide</a> or
the <a href="index.html">Windows Phone 8 Platform Guide</a>.

To enable shell tools for Windows Phone development, download Cordova
from [cordova.apache.org](http://cordova.apache.org). The download
contains separate archives for each platform. Expand each you wish to
target, `wp8` in this case, which in turn is forked into `wp7` and
`wp8` subdirectories. The relevant tools are typically available
in the top-level `bin` directory, otherwise consult the __README__
file for more detailed directions.

These tools allow you to create, build, and run apps.  For information
on the all-purpose command-line interface that enables plugin
features, see <a href="../../../plugin_ref/plugman.html">Using Plugman to Manage Plugins</a>. See Application Plugins
for details on how to develop plugins.

## Windows Phone

The Windows Phone command-line tools support creating, building, and
running new projects. Commands must be run from a cmd or powershell
prompt.

The `WP8` repo now includes code to build both WP7 and WP8 apps.  The
repo has subdirectories for each: `wp7/` and `wp8/`.

## Create a Project

There are 2 ways to go about creating a new Apache Cordova WP7 or WP8 application.

### Run the Batch <a href="../../../cordova/file/fileobj/fileobj.html">File</a> to Create and Install the Templates

- The root of the repo contains a `createTemplates.bat` file.
  Double-clicking it generates two `.zip` files:
  `CordovaWP7_x_x_x.zip` and `CordovaWP8_x_x_x.zip`, where _3.3.0_
  represents the current version number. To easily use these files in
  Visual Studio, copy them to `My Documents\Visual Studio
  2012\Templates\ProjectTemplates\`. You are then able to create
  new Apache Cordova Windows Phone apps from Visual Studio's
  __<a href="../../../cordova/file/fileobj/fileobj.html">File</a> &rarr; New Project__ menu.

- If you run the batch file from the command line, you can also call with a parameter to install automatically

Run the script :

        >createTemplates.bat -install

### Use the Create Scripts on the Command Line

Run the `create` command, specifying the existing path to the project,
the reverse-domain-style package identifier, and the app's display
name.  Here is the syntax for both Windows Phone 7 and 8:

        >.\wp7\bin\create PathToNewProject [ PackageName ] [ AppName ]
        >.\wp8\bin\create PathToNewProject [ PackageName ] [ AppName ]

        >PathToNewProject : The path to where you wish to create the project
        >PackageName      : The namespace for the project (default is Cordova.<a href="../../../cordova/splashscreen/<a href="../../../cordova/splashscreen/splashscreen.show.html">splashscreen.show</a>.html">Example</a>)
        >AppName          : The name of the application (default is CordovaWP8AppProj or CordovaWP7AppProj)

        >examples:
        >.\wp7\bin\create C:\path\to\my_new_project
        >.\wp8\bin\create C:\path\to\my_new_project io.cordova.example CordovaWP8App

Launch Visual Studio and open Solution file (.sln) in (C:\path\to\my_new_project)

Build and Run it

## Building the Project (Clean, then Build)

* Debug

        $ C:\path\to\my_new_project\cordova\build --debug

* Release

        $ C:\path\to\my_new_project\cordova\build --release

## Running the App

Run the 'run' command with the following *optional* parameters

* Target specification. This includes `--emulator`, `--device`, or `--target=<targetID>`.

* Build specification. This includes `--debug`, `--release`, or `--nobuild`.

        $ C:\path\to\my_new_project\cordova\run [Target] [Build]

By default the `run` command is called with `--emulator --debug` if flags are not provided.

## Cleaning

        $ C:\path\to\my_new_project\cordova\clean
