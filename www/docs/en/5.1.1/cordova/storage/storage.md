# Storage

> An overview of storage options for Cordova.

Several storage APIs are available for Cordova applications.
See
[html5rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/storage).
for a more complete overview and examples.

## LocalStorage

Also known as _web storage_, _simple storage_, or by its alternate
_session storage_ interface, this API provides synchronous key/value
pair storage, and is available in underlying WebView implementations.
Refer to [the W3C spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/) for details.

## WebSQL

This API is available in the underlying WebView.
The [Web SQL Database Specification](http://dev.w3.org/html5/webdatabase/)
offers more full-featured database tables accessed via SQL queries.

The following platforms support WebSQL:

- Android
- BlackBerry 10
- iOS
- Tizen

## IndexedDB

This API is available in the underlying WebView.
[Indexed DB](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/) offers more features
than LocalStorage but fewer than WebSQL.

The following platforms support IndexedDB:

- BlackBerry 10
- Firefox OS
- Windows Phone 8
- Windows 8

## Plugin-Based Options

In addition to the storage APIs listed above, the
[File API](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/blob/master/doc/index.md)
allows you to cache data on the local file system.  Other
[Cordova plugins](http://plugins.cordova.io/) provide similar storage options.
