title: backbutton
---

backbutton
===========

This is an event that fires when the user presses the back button.

    document.addEventListener("backbutton", yourCallbackFunction, false);

Details
-------

If you need to override the default back button behaviour you can register an event listener for the 'backbutton' event.  It is no longer necessary to call any other method to over ride the back button behaviour.  Now, you only need to register an event listener for 'backbutton'.

Typically, you will want to attach an event listener with `document.addEventListener` once you receive the Cordova '[deviceready](events.deviceready.html)' event.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

- Android
- BlackBerry WebWorks (OS 5.0 and higher)
- Windows Phone 7 ( Mango )

Quick [Example](../storage/storage.opendatabase.html)
-------------

    document.addEventListener("backbutton", onBackKeyDown, false);

    function onBackKeyDown() {
        // Handle the back button
    }
