Was first introduced to Cordova in 2015 to build upon and maintain a cloud-based integrated development environment for building Cordova apps. At the same time supported Cordova plugins. Eventually became an Apache Cordova committer in 2018.

During free time, enjoys researching and experimenting with the latest
programming features to see how it could be integrated with Cordova to improve the performance, simplify development, and decrease code snuff.
