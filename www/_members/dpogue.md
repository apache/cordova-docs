Building apps with Cordova since 2012, Darryl started contributing patches and bugfixes before joining as a committer in 2016.  He's a self-described "Web Fanatic" who longs to see projects embrace the web platform.  During his free time, he juggles too many unfinished side projects, along with hiking, amateur radio activities, and keeping up with browser developments.
