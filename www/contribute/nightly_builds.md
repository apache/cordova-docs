# Nightly builds

**Nightly builds are not official releases and should not be used in production.**

They are generated and published to the NPM registry around 3 PM UTC under the `@nightly` dist tag.

The following NPM packages are being released as a part of the nightly builds:

- cordova (cordova-cli)
- cordova-lib
- cordova-common
- cordova-fetch
- cordova-serve
- cordova-create
- xcode (cordova-node-xcode)
- cordova-android
- cordova-electron
- cordova-ios

## Notice

Nightly builds are intended for testing purposes onlyâ€”such as trying out unreleased features, verifying bug fixes, or identifying new issues before an official release.

These builds are created daily from the main branch and may be **unstable**. They are untested, may contain known and unknown defects, undeclared features, and perhaps other issues.

## Installing Cordova CLI Nightly Builds

The Cordova CLI nightly build can be installed either locally (project scope) or globally.

### Install locally (project scope):

```zsh
npm install cordova@nightly
npx cordova --version
```

### Install globally:

```zsh
npm install -g cordova@nightly
cordova
```

> **Note:** Installing globally will replace any existing Cordova installation.

## Installing Cordova Platform Nightly Builds

Cordova CLI uses npm to install platforms and plugins, as they are distributed as npm packages. To install a nightly build of a platform, simply append the `@nightly` tag to the platform name in the `platform add` command.

For example:

```zsh
cordova platform add ios@nightly
```

## Submitting Issues

If you encounter any issues with the nightly builds, please report them to the appropriate GitHub repository.

For details on how to report issues, see the [Reporting Issues](./issues.md) guide.

When submitting, **mention that the issue occurred using a nightly build** and include the version by running:

```bash
cordova --version
```
