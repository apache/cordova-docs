<h1 id="windows-8-shell-tool-guide">Windows 8 Shell Tool Guide</h1>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cordova</code> command-line utility is a high-level tool that allows
you to build applications across several platforms at once. An older
version of the Cordova framework provides sets of command-line tools
specific to each platform. To use them as an alternative to the CLI,
you need to download this version of Cordova from
<a href="http://cordova.apache.org">cordova.apache.org</a>. The download contains
separate archives for each platform. Expand the platform you wish to
target. The tools described here are typically available in the
top-level <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin</code> directory, otherwise consult the <strong>README</strong> file for
more detailed directions.</p>

<p>For information on the low-level command-line interface that enables
plugins, see <a href="../../../plugin_ref/plugman.html">Using Plugman to Manage Plugins</a>. See Application Plugins
for an overview.</p>
