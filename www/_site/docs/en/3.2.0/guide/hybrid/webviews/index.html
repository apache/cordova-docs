<p>Cordova applications are ordinarily implemented as a browser-based
<em>WebView</em> within the native mobile platform. This section shows how,
for supporting platforms, to create your own WebView components that
make full use of Cordova APIs. You can then deploy these Cordova
application components along with native components in a hybrid
application.</p>

<p>To deploy a WebView, you need to be familiar with each native
programming environment. The following provides instructions for
supported platforms:</p>
