<h2 id="platform-pinning">Platform Pinning</h2>

<p>Cordova CLI manages a list of pinned Apache Cordova maintained platforms. When there is a major release of Cordova CLI, the platform’s pinned version is updated to the latest released version. Typically, the updating of this pin is made only on a major release of CLI. This is because the pinned versions are pinned with a caret <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^</code> allowing CLI to continue to fetch new minor and patch releases of any given pinned platform.</p>

<p>To see the pinned platforms for your CLI version, execute the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cordova platform list</code>  in a brand new project directory.</p>

<p><strong>Cordova CLI 9.x:</strong></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>cordova platform list
Installed platforms:

Available platforms:
  android ^8.0.0
  browser ^6.0.0
  electron ^1.0.0
  ios ^5.0.0
  osx ^5.0.0
  windows ^7.0.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using the above information, when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cordova platform add android</code> is executed, the latest minor/patch release version starting from 8.0.0 or after (8.x.x) will be fetched. If a version is provided, it will fetch the given version. E.g <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cordova platform add ios@5.0.1</code> will fetch Cordova iOS 5.0.1.</p>

<p><em>Note: When a platform is installed, the “<strong>Installed platforms:</strong>” section will display the actual installed platform version. The installed platform will no longer display in the “<strong>Available platforms:</strong>” section until it is removed from the project.</em></p>
