<h1 id="os-x-platform-guide">OS X Platform Guide</h1>

<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> The OS X platform is now deprecated and may be removed from a future version of Cordova.</p>

<p>This guide shows how to set up your SDK development environment to
deploy Cordova apps for OS X computers. See the
following for more detailed platform-specific information:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="config.html">OS X Configuration</a></li>
  <li><a href="plugin.html">OS X Plugins</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The command-line tools above refer to versions prior to Cordova 3.0.
See <a href="../../cli/index.html">The Command-Line Interface</a> for information about the
current interface.</p>

<h2 id="requirements-and-support">Requirements and Support</h2>

<p>Apple® tools required to build OS X applications run only on the OS X
operating system on Intel-based Macs. Xcode® 6.0 (the minimum required
version) runs only on OS X version 10.9 (Mavericks) or greater, and
includes the OS X SDK (Software Development Kit). To submit apps to
the Apple App Store℠ requires the latest versions of the Apple tools.</p>

<p>You can test all of the Cordova features using the XCode or any other
IDE such as <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/">JetBrain’s AppCode</a>, but
you need to use XCode to sign before submitting to the
App Store. To sign the apps, you must also be a member of Apple’s
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/osx/">OS X Developer Program</a>.</p>

<h2 id="install-the-sdk">Install the SDK</h2>

<p>There are two ways to download Xcode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">App Store</a>,
available by searching for “Xcode” in the <strong>App Store</strong> application.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action">Apple Developer Downloads</a>,
which requires registration as an Apple Developer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once Xcode is installed, several command-line tools need to be enabled
for Cordova to run. From the <strong>Xcode</strong> menu, select <strong>Preferences</strong>,
then the <strong>Downloads</strong> tab. From the <strong>Components</strong> panel, press the
<strong>Install</strong> button next to the <strong>Command Line Tools</strong> listing.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-new-project">Create a New Project</h2>

<p>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cordova</code> utility to set up a new project, as described in The
Cordova <a href="../../cli/index.html">The Command-Line Interface</a>. For example, in a source-code directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>cordova create hello com.example.hello <span class="s2">"HelloWorld"</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>hello
<span class="nv">$ </span>cordova platform add osx
<span class="nv">$ </span>cordova prepare              <span class="c"># or "cordova build"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="run-the-app">Run the app</h2>

<p>To run the app on your desktop:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>cordova run
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And you should see a bordered window with the example app:</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/guide/platforms/osx/helloworld_run.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can also use <strong>cordova run –help</strong> to see additional build and run
options.</p>

<h2 id="open-a-project-in-the-sdk">Open a Project in the SDK</h2>

<p>Once osx platform is added to your project, you can open it from
within Xcode. Double-click to open the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello/platforms/osx/HelloWorld.xcodeproj</code>
file. The screen should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/guide/platforms/osx/xcode10-review-project.png" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>TIP</strong>
You can also use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open</code> command to open the XCode project directly
from the command line:</p>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ open platforms/osx/HelloWorld.xcodeproj
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="common-problems">Common Problems</h2>

<p><strong>Deprecation Warnings</strong>: When an application programming interface
(API) is changed or replaced by another API, it is marked as
<em>deprecated</em>.  The API still works in the near term, but is eventually
removed.  Some of these deprecated interfaces are reflected in Apache
Cordova, and Xcode issues warnings about them when you build and
deploy an application.</p>

<p><strong>Missing Headers</strong>: Compilation errors relating to missing headers
result from problems with the build location, and can be fixed
via Xcode preferences:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Select <strong>Xcode → Preferences → Locations</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <strong>Derived Data</strong> section, press the <strong>Advanced</strong> button and
select <strong>Unique</strong> as the <strong>Build Location</strong> as shown here:</p>

    <p><img src="/static/img/guide/platforms/osx/xcode10-build-location.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This is the default setting for a new Xcode install, but it may be set
differently following an upgrade from an older version of Xcode.</p>
